Just say no to chemical treatments on non stick pans, get yourself and your friends a few sizes of cast iron and have pans that you can pass down to your children, without all those unknown chemicals that are such a part of pans for the last few decades.This is an absolutely amazing skillet!!

Cast iron is much better than stainless for fried eggs, and this spacious 15" pan would provide considerably more room for frying and could saute more without getting so crowded that the food gets steamed.I want it to work out, but I might have to downsize to the 13 inch skillet because I don't see a practical way to heat a pan this large evenly.The pan is heavy and very high quality.
