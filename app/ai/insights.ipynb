The coating flaked off, got my hands black, and smelled really rusty.  No WAY I could cook with it that way!It has taken me about five rounds of boiling soapy water and then vinegar and water to get most of that nasty coating off of there with a steel scurbber.  (Then I seasoned by coating with oil and heating in the oven for 20 minutes.I'm still wary of that residue.  Never have I seen (and smelled) so much rust (trapped UNDER the coating) come off a skillet--new or badly stored in a garage.  This was horrible.I'm used to cast iron, for sure.

       " \"I got this for the hype of searing steaks and etc on cast iron. Having no experience with it at all I just did some google searches to figure out how to &#34;season&#34; it etc. For me, I opened it up and rubbed a small layer of oil on it and preheated it in the oven to 500 fahrenheit as per the recipe I followed for a steak. I added the layer of oil because I wasn't sure if the &#34;pre seasoned&#34; would ruin my dinner or not. Anyway, took it out of the oven and onto the stove, dropped the steak and ended up with an awesome dinner and no mess or smoke. Next day, cooked eggs and ham on it, no stick and no mess. Excellent excellent excellent!\",\n",
       " 'First off, I\\'m an absolute idiot in the kitchen.  Aside from toast and the occasional omelet, the only things I can make with any success are on the grill.  Alas, I live in an apartment and it isn\\'t feasible for me to have an outdoor grill.  Enter the Lodge 12 inch cast iron skillet.  I bought this, somewhat reluctantly, as what I at the time considered a poor replacement for a \"real\" grill.Now, obviously this isn\\'t exactly the same as grilling, but for some things - particularly lean steaks and pork chops, it does an excellent job.  In fact, after cooking my first fillet Mignon in this skillet I realized it\\'s actually better suited to this cut of meat than an outdoor grill - it leaves a perfectly seared, caramelized exterior and a nice red interior (just like I like it).  Like I said, it does a similarly excellent job for pork chops and other relatively lean cuts of beef.  It also can also be used to fry up a pretty mean burger - but be warned, burgers, and other fattier cuts of meat, create a LOT of smoke when cooked indoors on this baby, even with a window cracked and the exhaust fan on (I cooked a ribeye a while back that left my apartment smelling like a bbq pit for like 3 days, it was worth it though).Cleaning it is easy.  I just get it hot (either by cleaning soon after using it or heating it up in the oven before cleaning) and scrub with some kosher salt and a paper towel, rinsing it out afterwards (and immediately wiping it off, I don\\'t leave it to dry as it could rust).In short - this thing is great, and well worth the price.  It\\'s truly nonstick, and it gives a great sear.  For certain cuts of meat, like chops and burgers, it\\'s a good substitute for a real grill.  For others, like a fillet Mignon, it\\'s better than most grills due to the perfectly caramelized exterior.  It\\'s also extremely durable and should last forever if you take care of it.',\n",

The explosive flavor that this thing produces due all the yummy fats and sauces that have seeped into it are the best part, though.There are a few downsides of course: 1) It's heavy as hell, 2) the handle gets too hot to hold without a mitten, 3) it takes a little bit longer to heat up than standard skillets that are thinner, 4) it's kind of easy to burn your fingers on the edges of the skillet when you go to stir the food, and 5) I hear that you can ruin the skillet if you use soap to clean it.\",\n",

I'd never cooked with one and found the idea of using something not coated in teflon pretty intimidating.Then, I got this Lodge cast iron skillet.  Before using it, I read several articles online about properly seasoning, cooking with, and cleaning cast iron and followed these directions to the letter.  Even though the skillet is pre-season, I seasoned it myself using bacon grease.  I rubbed on some bacon grease, popped the skillet into the oven, heated it for a while, took it out, let it cool, then repeated.  The first couple of times I used the skillet, it produced a lot of smoke.  As the skillet becomes more seasoned over time, it smokes less.To clean my cast iron skillet, I pour avocado oil into it while it's still warm and dump in some coarse sea salt.  I use a clean, lint-free cloth to scrub the oil and salt into the skillet, removing any cooked on food.  Then, I give it a good rinse in hot water and place the skillet into a hot oven until it is dry (quickly drying with heat avoids a build up of rust).  Once the skillet is dry, I pour in just a bit of oil and spread it around before storing the pan until the next use.With good care and a bit of effort, cast iron is a kitchen essential.  I love using it to sear meats, then finishing in the oven.  It's great for bacon, corn bread, home made tortillas, and so many other things.  I wish I'd gotten a good cast iron skillet years ago, but I do enjoy making up for lost time!  This skillet is very heavy; the extra handle is there because you really do need to use it.  Unless you have arms of steel.  Which I don't.  Regardless, this is a great cast iron piece to start with and you can't beat the price!\",\n",

       " \"While a cracked or fractured skillet is NEVER good . . .I bought this skillet from Kroger grocery store as I was away from home and did not have my own cookware.  What did I find to be true?  Yes, absolutely, there is a texture to this skillet.  Yes, there are some places where the texture is sticking up a little higher (one or two places the size of a sharpened pencil), but it has not caused me any issues and they are wearing down.  Lodge has always made a high quality skillet.  If you carefully examine most cast iron cookware, you will see some imperfections.The first three times I used my skillet, I re-seasoned it at 450 degrees.  The pre-seasoning done by Lodge is good for a foundation, but you should expect to improve upon it.  I do not use soap (although the Lodge website says that a small amount won't hurt it) because my grandmother would roll over in her grave, if I did it.  I scrub the skillet with a nylon brush until it is as clean as I can get it.  I then use a Lodge scraper (bought from Amazon: Lodge SCRAPERPK Durable Polycarbonate Pan Scrapers, Red and Black, 2-Pack) and scrape off any remaining food.  I dry the skillet immediately and while it is still warm, spread extra virgin light olive oil on the pan (inside and out).  I use my hands and not a paper towel to avoid leaving lint on the pan.  I also use my hands because it is easier to control how thin the oil is spread.  It should be coated, but not overly shiny and definitely not dripping.  If it is too shiny, I use a junk bath cloth to remove oil.  After sliding a sheet of aluminum foil on the oven shelf on the bottom, I slip my skillet into the pre-heated over on the middle shelf and set the timer for an hour.  After an hour, I cut off the heat and let the oven (and the skillet) return to room temperature (don't open the oven door, as the slower the heat drop, the better).  When the oven is back at room temperature, I take out the skillet and store it in my cabinet.  After the third seasoning routine, I did not have to do it again at 450 degrees.How do I take care of my cookware on a daily basis?  I cook on it daily and have cooked everything from eggs to hamburgers, pancakes, etc. I only cook on medium or just a bit over medium, since anything beyond that might burn the food.  I clean my skillet with a nylon brush, drying it immediately.  I spread a thin layer of olive oil on the inside of the skillet and then wipe it down with the bath cloth (all over).  Every third or fourth time I use it, I re-season it at a lower temperature (say 350 degrees).  My grandmother got to a point when she only seasoned her pans two or three times per year.Also, I would prefer to use flax seed oil in the seasoning process, but, if you do your research, there are all sorts of debates on what type oil to use.  I use extra light olive oil when I have it and flax seed oil when I can get my hands on it.\",\n",
       " \"As a lover of cast iron this was a great piece. I purchased it so as to use it in my toaster oven and it works great for that purpose. The larger skillets don't work as well. Also this smaller skillet lets me make smaller portions, another reason I purchased it. Thanks for a great product.\",\n",
       " \"This is the first cast iron pan I've ever used and it's wonderful.  We all know what a pain it can be to clean up eggs, but even after burning them, this pan still cleaned up easily.  After a second try at a lower heat level, I could actually watch the eggs lift from the pan when they were ready to be flipped.  Lodge Logic also makes a pan called the one egg wonder... well, I think this is the 2-3 egg wonder.  However, it's certainly not limited to eggs.  One piece of bread fits perfectly so grilled cheeses, toasted sandwiches and the like are great here too, among other things.It fit the small burner on my electric stove perfectly.  It covers all of the coils so no uncovered heat and all the dangers that that implies.If you're new to cast iron, as I am, make sure to use something when touching the handle.  I'm used to being able to grabbing the handle of anything that's on the stove and with this one that's not the case, which I fortunately figured out before it got too hot.\",\n",
       " 'I purchased three of these pans a couple of years ago.  I use them all the time to heat up left overs, make pies, bake bread, cook eggs, fry bacon, and anything else that fits into it.  These were my first cast iron pans.  I burned the first thing I tried to cook by using too high of a heat and not seasoning it first.  I do recommend that you season it before using it and after each time it is used.  After washing, I put it on a medium heat, coat it lightly with oil using a paper towel, let it heat for a few minutes, then wipe it clean and cool it down before storing it again.  This works great! These pans are now nonstick and clean up very easily. When I have used the procedure that Lodge recommends, my cast iron has become gummy.',\n",
       " \"7 years later, I'm still using this same skillet; it has been reseasoned once or twice (to get progressively better seasoning), and is still going strong.A tip: the best seasoning process I've found to give a hard, slick surface is 5+ very thin coats of flax seed oil, wiping it off after apply the oil and before baking.

The minute I received it, I cleaned it and started using it.  Used it twice that day.  First I fried some pork chops on it and later that day we made a pineapple cake.

I never leave it wet- I dry it off by putting on gas stove and add some oil so its ready for my next use. My daughter advised that the more I use the less it will stick - she was right. She uses these pans on an electric stove while I use gas- same results. I would advise to never set burner on high.

The more you add, the more spicy it will be. Next, add the turkey and mix it all together. While all those ingredients are sharing their flavor with each other, crack all the eggs and beat them in a bowl. DO NOT ADD MILK TO EGGS. When all the meat is fully cooked to your preference (everyone likes their bacon at a different crunch level), add the eggs to the skillet. Continue to cook and fold the eggs in on itself until eggs are fully cooked. Serve right away and while still hot, mix a small handful of cheese into your eggs. Add salt, pepper, or more Tapatio hot sauce if you would like, and enjoy!',\n",
       " \"I have a small gas grill, and this little frying pan has become my favorite and most useful grilling accessory. It fits on the grill (even with the grill's cover closed) and still leaves room for a steak or a couple of burgers. But it's big enough to hold a medium potato. Smaller veggies, like sliced onions or mushrooms, can be put on at about the same time as the meat. Skillet Potatoes should go on the grill 15 or 20 minutes before the meat. The pan is heavy enough to let you stir food without pushing the pan around too much. Make sure the skillet is seasoned inside and out, so if the meat bumps into the skillet it won't stick. They make all kinds of gadgets to grill veggies and other small stuff on the grill, but a plain old cast iron pan does just fine. Plus you can use it for bacon and eggs as well.\",\n",
       " \"I have to guess that cast iron is one of those things that, either you grow up with it and you are used to it, or no one in your family has ever owned one and you just don't get why anyone would want one of these pans.  I will openly admit that I was firmly entrenched in the second category until the age of 42....  I have always been of the mindset, I hate being in the kitchen, and everything that goes along with it, so why put any energy into looking into anything new.  Well, for all of my adult life, I had lived with cheap non-stick pans and when my last set went, my husband went and got me a Rachel Ray set for much more than I had ever spent.  Well, that was about 4 years ago, and the inside of every pot is peeling and flaking.  I decided that I wasn't going to keep eating my pots, so wanted something without a non-stick coating, and I'm too bad a cook to go for a plain metal pot, because I had visions of all of the scrubbing I would have to do to get off burnt food.  I looked at the cast iron, and decided that the price wasn't bad, and if I hated cooking on it, it is heavy enough to make a good weapon if anyone breaks into my house.  Well, I have to say, I used this to cook bacon (which I am terrible at cooking), and I made the most perfect batch of bacon of my life.  I have also used it to make a mean chicken marsala, eggs, browned some ground beef, etc.  This is now my go to pan, and I will be ordering more in the very near future.  For the record, they state that you should use some oil the first few times you cook so it doesn't stick, and I did find that to be helpful, but even when my eggs stuck a little, it was easy enough to scrape right off.\",\n",

I was a little apprehensive, as I never used cast iron before. Believe me or not, the thing is NON STICK to about the same degree as the non-stick pans. Being much heavier, it does not have cold/hot spots. Cooks on lower heat, too. Surprisingly easy to clean.

Throw two pounds of mussels into it, right out of the box, or a big steak, or a pan pizza.

       " \"When I was growing up, my mother had a ten inch cast iron skillet in which she cooked almost everything. One of my best memories is when I was standing by her side, watching her fix red-eye gravy, fried chicken, eggs, vegetables, sauces of an amazing variety. If it could be cooked, it could be cooked in her cast iron skillet.That skillet now resides in my kitchen, and it is still used for almost everything, even though my style of cooking has changed a bit from what I learned from my mother. Between a cast iron dutch oven (also from my mother's kitchen) and this skillet, for every day cooking, I have almost all I need (my other 'necessary' is a good coffee maker, but that's another story.) I suppose I should mention here that I am well over my second 20th birthday. Both the the skillet and dutch oven have been in use for at least half a century. I'm not sure how long the well-seasoned skillet was in use before it came to my mother. I do know that it was not new when she began using it.It occurred to me one day that I might be passing these wonderful things along to yet another generation. While I would be happy to bequeath my mother's tools, I also wanted something of mine to go with them. I thought another skillet would be just the thing.This skillet is bigger than my mother's. It might not be suitable for everyday cooking the way hers is. But once in a while, a large skillet is called for, and this one is perfect. It's big enough to cook large amounts of food, but not too large to handle. I've had it for a while now, and it's just starting to acquire that wonderful, smooth black surface that all cast iron gets, if used and cared for correctly. I've had no problems at all with it.I know there are proponents of cast iron cookware and there are those who don't understand what all the hoopla is about. Cast iron is certainly not for everyone. I have an aunt who will not cook in anything but good stainless steel and who looks down her nose at anything cast iron. So be it, that's her choice and far be it from me to question any good cook's choices. Different schools of cooking have different tastes and that's fine.If you've ever really used good cast iron cookware, however, you will appreciate this skillet. Throw out all pre-conceived notions of how cooking &#34;should&#34; be done, and you might come to believe that almost everything, from soup to desserts, tastes better when cooked in cast iron. I would recommend a good skillet for any newcomer to start with, though maybe not this large.For those who are newcomers, let me say this: Good seasoning is an absolute requirement for ALL cast iron cookware. Without it you run the risk not only of ruining your food, but of ruining a wonderful cooking tool. If you simply cannot bring yourself to season it with animal fat, use Crisco. Vegetable oil of any kind out of a bottle just won't do the job. Use it liberally and in the beginning, use it often. I would recommend seasoning the pot or pan or skillet at least twice - three times is better - before you use it. Don't use soap on it for at least two years. To loosen stuck particles, heat the pan, dump in hot water, and let it boil for a few minutes. Wipe dry completely, and oil liberally while the pan still retains some heat. If rust spots should ever develop (which should not happen if the pan is cared for correctly), scour the spots with steel wool until completely gone and then re-season the pan as if it was brand new. All cast iron under ten years old should be re-seasoned every few months.Too much to do just to have a skillet or pan to use? Maybe, if you're too busy to cook a lot. Most people, I suppose, simply don't want to bother with the care needed for cast iron to become an actual heirloom. I can understand that, but I think it's a little sad. How many products that are used almost every day can you pass along to your grandchildren, especially ones that can be such great repositories of wonderful, happy memories? To me, using and caring for this cookware is a form of nurturing my family and even descendants I don't have yet. It represents a family tradition and there aren't all that many anymore that we can hand down over the years. The tools we use to live our everyday lives are the basis of those traditions. Hopefully, this skillet will now be one of them.\",\n",

Despite these traits, it's still not as good as an antique Griswold skillet from the 1940s, because the antique skillet has a much smoother metal finish on the cooking surface, making it much more nonstick.

I was hesitant that the quality of this pan would be poor after checking the price, but I must say I am pleasantly suprised.  I bought this pan mainly to make cornbread in and though it is a little large it sure can make one heck of a good pan of cornbread.  Growing up in the south I learned quick that cornbread that is actually worth eating must be made with a few simple ingredients:  cornmeal, buttermilk, fatback grease, and most importantly, cast iron.  Lodge makes the cookware a breeze to use since these pans are pre-seasoned.  They're easy to take care of and fairly simple to clean up.  I find that just filling it with piping hot water while the pan is still hot removes most of the residue.  Anything else can be wiped out with a towel or a sponge, but NO soap.  Then just spray with a little vegetable spray while it's still warm and you're all done.  You can't ask for easier bakeware.  The people at lodge craft their items in a small town in Tennessee.

I regret not cooking with cast iron sooner. I seasoned it as soon as I got it home and that was really easy to do. It isn't that difficult to maintain either. I clean it with only hot water and scrap it with bristle brush after the skillet is cooled. Then I dry it and even heat it a little to really make sure it dries completely. Don't want any rust on it!

       " '5 stars for cast iron, and 5 stars for Lodge.  Nevertheless, I found this \"15 inch\" skillet very difficult to cook with because it heats so unevenly.This skillet is massive so it is a very large heat sink.  I heat it on a 12.5\" electric cooktop element.  I have not seen too many elements (gas or electric) larger than this.On high heat, the center of the pan expands substantially and the outside so much less that the pan deforms and the bottom cones.  This exacerbates the uneven heating because as the pan deforms the edges lift off the cooktop and the pan teeters on the bulge in the center of the bottom, further heating the center and cooling the perimeter.  Gas burners do not need flat bottoms so much but they are usually smaller in diameter than my 12.5\" electric element and may also have trouble heating the perimeter.Pancakes didn\\'t work.  Even though I cooked 9-10\" diameter cakes, the perimeter of the pan works like a heat sink to draw heat away, leaving the center much hotter than even the circumferance of the pan bottom that is directly over the heating element.French toast didn\\'t work.  The difference between the center and the edges was enough to burn the toast in the center and leave the pieces around the edges undercooked.  Further cooking the edge pieces resulted in visible differences between the outside and inside edge of the piece (light to dark).I thought I could overcome the size and mass of this thing by preheating it and working with awareness of the thermodynamic problems it presents, but I have not had practical success so far.My reference pan is a well seasoned All Clad Cop-R-Chef 12\" fry pan.  The All Clad with its aluminum core heats very evenly.  Cast iron is much better than stainless for fried eggs, and this spacious 15\" pan would provide considerably more room for frying and could saute more without getting so crowded that the food gets steamed.I want it to work out, but I might have to downsize to the 13 inch skillet because I don\\'t see a practical way to heat a pan this large evenly.',\n",

I use Alton Brown's salt cleaning method (just google it, there's a video where he explains it).To cook steak, I use the 3/3/3 method.  Season the steak with some salt and pepper or a rub.  Let it sit for 10-20 minutes. Put a couple of drops of oil in the skillet.  Preheat the skillet in the oven (450-500 degrees).  Take the skillet out, and put it on the stovetop on high heat.  Put the steak in there for 3 minutes, then flip.  Wait another 3 minutes, then put the iron skillet in the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes.Chicken breasts are done the same way, except they'll take about 10 minutes in the oven.  Use an oven thermometer to monitor the temperature of the chicken breasts.  It should get to 160-165 degrees in the thickest portion of the chicken breast.  I usually season the chicken with a rub.\",\n",

But don\\'t expect it to be just like a non-stick skillet or you\\'ll be disappointed - it does take some care and some breaking-in.Even though it\\'s pre-seasoned, I seasoned it further by heating oil in it to smoking a couple of times, and I still use a tiny bit of oil when I cook in it. And unlike non-stick pans, it\\'s iron and will rust, so after washing (water only, no soap) I dry it well and wipe it with a little Crisco. Every once in a while something sticks but a quick scrub with a scrubber sponge takes care of it.The surface is a little more pebbly than my 40-yr old, 12\" cast-iron skillet (which has a mirror-like finish and nothing ever sticks to it) so eggs were a bit of a challenge at first, but after using it for 6 months they rarely stick; over time as I cook with it, it gets better and better.  Maybe after 40 yrs. this one, too, will develop a mirror-like finish and absolute non-stick surface.The best part is, it\\'s safe, no chemical coatings.

       " 'I own 2 of these little pans, 1 of them for over 30 years & the other had been my mom\\'s for many years beyond that.  Had I known back then what I know now (how many times have we all said that?), I would have bought mostly cast iron instead of all the other cookware.  It does take a little time to properly care for cast iron but it\\'s sooooo worth it to me.  These cast iron skillets turn out a great grilled cheese sandwich, too!  Just use a lid on the pan & be sure to cook only on medium-low heat.Several years ago my mom gave me a wonderful recipe (see below) to make cornbread on the stovetop in the 8\" skillet using a lid, flipping the cake over once the batter looks almost done to cook the other side.  You have to use 2 spatulas to flip it (the reason for using the 8\" skillet).  I tried flipping a 10\" ONCE & found it takes a better woman than I to get that right!  This technique makes a more moist & better cornbread according to my DH & me. Another added benefit is that you don\\'t have to heat up the oven/kitchen.In a small bowl, mix 1 cup of **self-rising white or yellow cornmeal, 1 Tbs. sugar (optional).  In a separate small bowl, whip 1 egg with fork & stir in 2/3 cup milk.  Add egg/milk mixture to cornmeal.  Stir together just until all is moist.  Melt 1 to 2 Tbs. shortening in skillet over medium heat.  Sprinkle pan with cornmeal (not too thick) stirring to brown it.  This will give you a crustier side.  Lower heat to medium-low & add batter to pan and cover.  Check batter & once it\\'s looking a little more done than a pancake would, flip the cake using 2 sturdy nylon spatulas.  I prefer to cover after flipping & it will be done in less than 5 more minutes.  For crustier bread leave lid off after flipping.  **Or use regular cornmeal with 2 tsp. aluminum free baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt in place of self-rising - I\\'m sort of guessing at these amounts as a replacement for self-rising.If you\\'d like to read my method of seasoning cast iron, go to the Lodge Biscuit pan and read my review there.Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Drop Biscuit PanMy DH laughs at me because of my admiration of raw cast iron, enameled cast iron and how I care for them.  I now have 2-10\", 1-12\", the biscuit pan, muffin pans, as well as the Lodge Pizza Pan.  The pizza pan makes a wonderful crust.  If we have left over pizza, we melt butter in one of the larger skillets over medium heat.  Put 2 or 3 slices in & cover with a lid.  Reduce heat to medium low.  It will take just a little patience but it will taste as if it were fresly baked.  You\\'ll probably stop warming pizza in the microwave.',\n",
       " \"**SAFETY TIP**  since these pans get very hot and stay hot, keep children away and make sure you use a pot holder or something to grab. These pans stay hot even a half hour later after turning off burners! The handles can burn you so be careful. Cast iron do not cool off like a regular pan.The Lodge iron skillets are excellent. 1st off you need to know these are VERY HEAVY. So if you aren't up to lifting and cooking with a pan that actually takes a bit of muscle don't bother with these. I'm not saying these are the heaviest things in the world, just they are not weak little cheap pans. They do require some lift in your arm to use these. Keep in mind they are iron and a very heavy metal.So why would you want these heavy pans? because they get VERY HOT and they stay hot. I have a great set of stainless steal pans and they never get this hot or retain their heat. I also have a very nice set of non stick, they are nice and great for certain cooking.These pans though are ideal for meats, searing, sausage, hamburger, all sorts of dishes that require high consistent heat. Another point is these pans should last a lifetime or longer. They are simple and durable...just a piece of metal that gets very hot and does what you need in the kitchen.This again is one of the many reason people love cooking with these pans.. they get very hot and stay hot. Any serious cook should have a set or a couple to use for those special homemade recipes mom or grandma used to make. These pans are where it's at!\",\n",

I have several good nonstick saute pans in stainless and mixed steel/copper, but they just don't hold the same energy that this pan does. When you're searing or sauteing, you need the pan to not cool off dramatically when you're adding food, and the mass of this pan means that the temperature drop is minimized. While you're cooking, it also means that the temperature is more consistent edge to edge. This pan is heavy, but that's what makes it work so well. I made a pan-seared steak this evening, which can be challenging to cook properly, but through consistent heating and predictability, it was easy in this skillet. I'd definitely buy it again.\",\n",

If need be it can be scrubbed down to bare metal and reseasond. Try THAT with teflon! I have been known to over use the \"high heat\" setting, and happens that from time to time, billows of smoke emerge from my kitchen. If that\\'s from a cast iron pan, it\\'s merely a ruined meal. If it\\'s my late, unlamented teflon-coated wok... it goes in the garbage WITH the ruined meal.This particular design is a perennial for many reasons. It would be found hanging from the side of chuckwagons and in the kitchens of great homes. It works equally well on gas, charcoal, wood fires and electric stoves, so it\\'s a camping essential.It\\'s rim is high enough to use as a saucepan - and that\\'s where the term \"pan gravy\" comes from. Controllable, even heat is the secret to good gravy - and of course, meat juices.It\\'s equally at home in the oven as on the stove - unlike many composite-handled stainless steel skillets. The crust of a pie baked in cast iron is equal to or superior to Pyrex.A twelve-inch steak and whatever pie, four inches deep will feed six to eight people easily.It will also fry six eggs at a time; doing duty as a griddle.All told, this skillet is one of the most generally useful items in the kitchen.

After use just wash with a brush, don't use soap, dry, and either heat it on the burner to get rid of any remaining water on the surface (which is what I do) or spray it with a cooking spray such as Pam (or lightly rub it with cooking oil and a paper towel [I don't do it this way because it seems unnecesary, but it's what's recommended, perhaps in more humid climates like at the ocean than the one I live in]).It's very nice that you can buy a Cook's Illustrated top performer at such a very reasonable price.\",\n",

After I ordered the 12 inch I read more reviews as I couldn\\'t wait to receive it and only then did I read that the 12 inches refers to the diameter from outer edge (angled) to outer edge and NOT the inner cooking surface.  Well, I started to panic that the inner dimension is only 10 inches and not the 12 I felt I was replacing.Great news:  when I just ten minutes ago received the pan I put it on my stove and laid my Farberware \"12\" inch skillet inside.  How typical, I assumed my Farberware was 12 inches, but low and behold, it measures only ten inches on the outer dimension and slightly less on the inside.  I NOW have 12 inch skillet with a slightly larger than 10 inch cooking surface which is about an inch bigger than what I thought I had in the Farberware piece.I am soooo glad I didn\\'t order the 15 inch Lodge skillet or I would actually have a pan that I could not fit on my glass cooktop and would not have been able to use, not to mention the extra four pounds for the bigger pan and an additional $15 pricetag.LESSON:  Measure your pan.  I was lucky and got what I really needed and not what I thought I needed.  You might not be so lucky if you don\\'t measure first.The 12 inch Lodge pan has a 10 inch cooking surface.  It is 12 inches on the outside from lip to lip.Please be careful because with cast iron you do need EXACTLY the right size for your glass stovetop as you can\\'t have an overhang of more than one inch or the stovetop can break as per manufacturers instructions.UPDATE:  I have had this pan for a little over 4 years now.  What a difference.  This is the pan I use about 95% of the time.  It sits on my stovetop full time and never leaves.  I cook in it twice a day, sometimes three times.  About a year ago I was getting frustrated because all the non-stick abilities were gone and I was getting little black pieces of \"seasoning\" in all my foods.  Eggs especially were no longer appetizing.  I quickly realized that by washing it with a scrub sponge and soap was erradicating my pan of its seasoning. In addition, the inside of the pan was looking like it was starting to rust.  I gave it a quick and thorough cleaning to get all the loose seasoning off and I have since been using only a soft sponge with little soap, and after that, heating up the pan for a minute (at most) with a little olive oil coating the pan.  Once it heats up, I turn off the burner and take a paper towel and wipe up any extra oil that might be in the pan.  Voila!  I once again have a beautiful non-stick pan that I love so much.  I really can\\'t say enough about it.  I never did get the All-Clad that I was so wanting and couldn\\'t be happier.If you want my advice...  If you are thinking about getting this pan and are sitting on the fence thinking it\\'s alot of work, please get it and see for yourself.  It\\'s not a big deal to keep it nice and it cooks the food wonderfully.  Steaks and seafood especially.  You will never get the same sear on your meats in a stainless skillet.  For anything that needs to be steamed, I simply add liquid, put the cast iron lid that I bought separately on top and veggies steam right in the pan.I really can\\'t say enough good things about cast iron cookware.',\n",

While I spent endless hours researching the relative merits of hard-anodized and stainless steel-clad cookware, I decided to pick this skillet up in the meantime because it looked A) inexpensive, B) easy to use, and C) pretty darn near indestructible.Three months later, we rarely use anything else!It works equally well for melting cheese on nachos or baking bread in the oven as it does for stir-frying vegetables and cooking omelets on the range.  The pre-seasoning process really works, and if the skillet is cared for properly (gentle handwashing, avoiding too high heat, always stored dry), the nonstick properties of the cooking surface only improve with time.  Do note that cast iron probably isn't for you if you just want to throw it in the sink overnight after use - it'll be a rusty mess the next day, and while this is fairly easy to correct with steel wool and a little effort, cast iron really shouldn't be treated this way.Cast iron is safe for use on a glass-top range; some range manufacturers recommend against it, but if you're careful not to drop or drag the skillet on the surface, it won't cause any damage (see comments).

I took one star off as I don't find the seasoning that comes on the Lodge products to stand up well. It's no real problems for me as I actually enjoy seasoning my cast iron myself and it just involved an extra step of stripping off the pre-seasoning which was easily accomplished. There are many ways to do this. I used oven cleaner-sprayed it on, wrapped it in plastic, and went to bed. Scrubbed it out easily the next morning and proceeded on to my seasoning method.

       " 'Worth the price.  Nice big 12\" skillet, no flaws in the casting, factory seasoning not that great.  The skillet heats relatively evenly once it comes up to temp.  I have an infrared thermometer I check it with.  There is about a 30-50 degree drop from the center to the edge on a kitchen burner.  I think the sides soak up some of the heat and that\\'s what causes the drop, not a bad casting; it\\'s not a griddle.  Bigger higher btu burner on the side of the grill heats it a little more evenly.  Factory seasoning was okay...  No rust no metal smell after I washed the stain off from the label.  It will need a some more seasoning right out of the box before it reaches it\\'s full potential.  There were a few nicks in the seasoning on the top edges and the tip of the handle.  Most likely from getting banged around in shipping.  Cooked some bacon first, it did stick a little in a dry skillet but no big deal to get it loose.  Cleaned the skillet with hot water and a stiff brush; no soap although I do use a small amount from time to time.  Fried some good quality frozen 1/4 lb burgers the next day.  Threw the frozen burgers 2 at a time on a 500 degree pre heated skillet (infrared thermometer is awesome) with no sticking problems.  The first flip required a little persuasion to loose but no real effort was required.  Burgers turned out great.I have since added several layers carbon and the seasoning is pretty good to go at this point.  I seasoned by cleaning it with a small amount of dish washing soap and hot water.  After it\\'s bone dry I add as thin a layer of soybean oil as possible over mostly just the cooking surface.  The sides, bottom, and handle don\\'t need much attention.  Put in a cold oven (I alternate facing up and down each time I do this) and set to 400.  Once it reaches temp I\\'ll let it bake for at lest an hour not more than two.  The idea with seasoning is to build thin layers of carbon on top of the iron.  What you want to be careful of is too not build layers of fat polymer chains instead of carbon.  If it looks glossy and it\\'s somewhat tacky that\\'s polymer chains and that\\'s not what you want.  Note properly well seasoned cast iron will look a little glossy too.  If it looks kind of oily and not too shiny you\\'ve got a properly seasoned piece of cast iron and it\\'s up to it\\'s full \"non stick\" potential.  The picture posted of the guys old skillet is a good example of this.  If it\\'s really shiny, similar to the paint on a car.  That\\'s your layer of polymer chains and it probably doesn\\'t perform well.  Only way to fix this is to strip down to bare iron and re-season properly.Bottom line...  Good skillet for the price but factory seasoning is not perfect.  Put a little work into it, clean and store it properly and it will serve you well.

       " \"I've been using my cast iron pans for several years, both in the home and while camping. I won't cook with anything else. The only drawback to cast iron is the weight, but use them for a few months and you won't even notice anymore.Unlike other pans that warp over time, or come warped from the factory, the cast iron always rests flat on the stove burners. That is so important. The heat spreads evenly across the pan's cooking surface. You'll never have hot and cold spots that cause burning and under cooking. The spout on the lip makes it easy to pour off liquids and grease.I've never had a problem using soap on my cast iron pans. I can't stand the black grime left behind when I only wipe out the pan with only a damp paper towel. I use soap and a scrubber to clean them. They stay seasoned regardless. Maybe that's because I cook a lot of bacon and eggs, and the grease re-seasons the pan each time. They are very easy to clean...and to re-season when necessary.Nothing burns unless I mistakenly burn it. If you're new to cast iron, it takes a bit of time getting used to them. They really retain the heat. Once you turn off the heat source, the food continues to cook.I love that I can cook directly over the wood campfire with these pans. There's no worry about melting, cracking or warping. Cast iron withstands the test of time. Once you start cooking in cast iron you will throw all your other pans away. You'll soon understand why our grandmothers cherished them.\",\n",

       " 'I purchased this little skillet for my husband who likes to make one egg over lightly every so often. I already have the 10.25 skillet and the square grill pan. All Lodge. This is a wonderful little pan and it is so easy to use. It does come pre-seasoned, but I gave it another seasoning after washing (no soap) before first use. I just place it on my NuWay Pic2 induction burner at 350 degrees.....just a little while until you can really feel the heat reaching all the way to the handle. I season it with a light coat of olive oil and let it sit for a bit. I wipe out the excess oil and store. I have been doing this every time I use the skillet (it takes such a little while), and the results are almost completely non-stick. I make a cheese omelet in it for myself and it just glides......no sticking issues, even with the cheese. The pan heats very evenly and quickly. It makes a big difference with the taste of the food. Wish I could explain it!!!!! It is so much healthier than using Teflon and other assorted non-stick coatings. It is not necessary to use extremely high heat because the cast iron is so efficient in spreading the temperature evenly. Medium high is the highest I ever go on my induction burner.  This is a very high quality product at a terrific price. As others have said, with proper care, you will NEVER have to replace it. This 6.5 inch size is perfect for small portions for one person. Obviously, if you have to prepare more food, then go for the size appropriate to your meal. The larger pans are quite heavy, but the extra handle is very useful so that you can carry them more easily. I plan on purchasing the 8 inch Lodge skillet as well. By the way, my husband loves preparing his food in this and swears it really does taste so much better. Who am I to argue. I highly recommend this excellent product.',\n",

Crank it up! Sear those chops and steaks. Don\\'t forget the Char Crust.Char Crust Hickory Grill Rub - 4ozThis is perfect for a two person meal. Two small steaks or two chops. (OK, light eaters). Nothing like really well grilled onions and mushrooms in cast iron. Pre-seasoned means not having to mess with oiling and hours of baking in the oven to get the nice coating. Always wash this cast iron with only water and a good scrub brush. Never use soap or you will have to start over with the seasoning procedure. Lodge quality just can\\'t be beat. Amazon of course has the best prices too. PS, I tried the handle pot holders and they work OK, but if you leave them on the handle, they do get hot, and there is always a danger that they will get too close to the flame on a gas stove.

       " \"I purchased this pan nearly a year ago, and am now adding to my set. I actually grew up with cast iron frying pans, but it has taken me some time to get used to using them again. I highly recommend these to anyone concerned about the chemicals that leach into your food from non-stick coating or traditionalists or even someone who wants to invest in a pan that will last you a lifetime and never need replacing. You can't break them, you can't ding them, and they won't warp. As long as you take care of them, they will not rust. And you probably get some minor iron intake from cooking in them regularly.Follow the manufacturers instructions about not using soap is the most important thing. Use a stainless steel scouring pad or other scrubber (brush, chain mail) to remove food shortly after cooking. I find that if I leave them dirty on the stove for a day or two, the food debris sort of act as moisture on the pan and can create rust.If you ever get a rust spot, scrub it immediately, dry the pan thoroughly (I like to put mine on the stove for 2 minutes on low to warm the pan and evaporate any moisture), and re-oil it lightly with olive oil or coconut oil on a paper towel. This includes the bottom, which may not make sense to anyone who is grease fire fearful, but we are talking about a light coating to seal out moisture, the pan should look dark on the outside, not shiny or dripping.My best suggestion is to fry bacon! Yes, fry bacon in each pan when you first get it. Although they are pre-seasoned, it is a light seasoning that needs to be reinforced with something greasy several times before you start to develop a deeper seasoning. Before this, you will find that foods will stick, aka, eggs. Stick with the pans, and they will not stick to your food after some time!  Keep to oily foods like bacon, ground beef, or frying something in oil, etc, until you see them darken up a bit, or even follow the manufacturer's instructions on reseasoning, but do it a few times in a row.It will probably take more than a year of regular use for these pans to develop that smooth bottom that you may remember your mama's pans had, but with proper care and oiling, they will be no-stick within a few weeks or months. Always use a bit of cooking oil or butter when you heat them up before adding food, unless it's bacon.Best of all, there is no need for plastic utensils to avoid scratching non-stick coating. You can use stainless steel or wooden!\",\n",

And yes, I wash my cast iron skillet, dry it and then I put it in a warm oven or heat it on the stove to ensure the moisture is out of the pan, so it doesn't rust. In my opinion, it's a healthier way to cook compared to aluminium or non-stick.

It fits perfectly over the center of a large burner when you put it in the corner of your stove.  Any bigger and you would not be able to center it over the heat.  The edges of the corner of your stove basically act like guides.  I cooked bacon on it the first time.  The stuff at the center cooked about 30% faster than on the edges.  This was expected since my burner has a much smaller radius than the bottom of this pan.  You just have to move your food around a little.  I have a glass top electric stove.  I'm guessing that would be less of a problem with a gas burner since the flame would spread outwardly and heat the bottom more uniformly than an electric burner.  Contrary to popular belief you can cook with cast iron on a glass top stove.  If this pan didn't break my stove top nothing will.  I am careful though when setting or lifting my cookware.  If you ever did accidentally drop this pan it would break your stove and probably your foot.  I bought mine refurbished.  It looked brand new to me.  They must strip down all the old seasoning to the bare metal and re season it. The seasoning is good for first time use.  A little sticking but gets better I've noticed on my other Lodge pans with subsequent uses.  Lodge's seasoning process is better than what you can do at home with just one application (in my experience at least).  They do it soon after the cast pan is removed from the mold and is still hot.  They are sprayed with mixture of soy oils and baked for 30 minutes at 700 degrees F.  I think they do this while the pan is still very hot because the iron is more porous at that time and the seasoning takes better.  I scrub my pans with a medium stiffness plastic bristle brush with steaming hot water and this has not harmed the seasoning.  I wish Lodge would polish the cooking surfaces of their pans.  They are a little gritty from the cast.  I have a Le Cruset cast iron pan that I polished down the surface to 400 grit sandpaper and after seasoning it is like glass.  It's as good as teflon without the toxic fumes and about 10% more stick resistant than a gritty cast iron surface upon initial use.  I'm thinking about doing this to my Lodge cast iron pans but don't want to risk the season not taking to it as good as the original. If the pores on the surface of the metal get clogged when sanding the seasoning does not take as good I've been told.  I've recently converted to cast iron from Analon anodized proffesional series teflon coated non-stick pans.  I did this after finding out how toxic teflon can be.  I can't believe for all my life I was fooled into thinking you can only cook on teflon.  Food does not stick to a well seasoned cast iron pan if the surface has been prepped properly before cooking each time.  They are easy to clean if you know what you are doing.  I run hot water over them while the pans are still hot.  To the point that the water steams.  Steam cleaning takes the grime right off and soap is not necessary.  I quickly dry my pan and rub a light coat of canola oil on it.  I own several pieces of Lodge cast iron cooking vessels and have been very happy with them all.  I have a triple ply stainless steel fry pan by All-Clad that was $150.  Overall, a $15 Lodge cast iron skillet outperforms in all areas other than weight.  I own some Le Cruset enameled pots.  I find food sticks to enameled cast iron surfaces more than a seasoned raw cast iron surface.  I swear that food cooked on cast iron tastes better than food cooked on Teflon coated aluminum.  I think the off gases from the teflon taint the food. After all you are cooking on plastic.  Also this pan would make a very good weapon if an intruder ever broke into your home.  Its got to weigh as much as a medieval battle mace.\",\n",

I have the 10-1/4, 13-1/4, and the square grill pan.  The grill pan makes cooking healthier but I like it the least because cleaning is a pain.',\n",

The other sizes certainly have uses as well, but if know you need a different size from the above, you probably have a good reason :)Always cook with some sort of fat in the pan: oil, butter, lard, etc. To clean, scrub with kosher salt (it's cheap!), preferably while the pan is still warm/hot, and dry immediately.\",\n",

Pre- seasoned or not.You definitely have to scrape out the leftovers, wipe it down, sometimes wipe it again, andthen season it again with oil. A bit more labor intensive than stainless or non-stick.The pan is almost 8 pounds and could be used as a lethal weapon against intruders. Itappears to be a well built pan without any sharp edges and has a useful second handlewhich will be hot to the touch.In retrospect after having used this pan for over a year I would have to say I'd go witha very good stainless steel pan and forgo using the heavy metal skillet unless needed asa backup or for home defense.Happy cooking to all and to all a good night...\",\n",

I think the other pan 'walked away'. I am still using that pan. Not only did it survive a house fire that melted even glass, it is still in fine condition!!!So, I bought this pan to replace its bother that was lost.

       " 'I prefer to cook with an open flame and the Cast Iron pans distribute the heat evenly and help with the cooking.  What I really like about cast iron is how well things fry up and brown.  The heat is distributed so well and things look and taste great after cooking in these pans and pots.  I use oil to keep the pan working well so if you are a non-oil cooker you might not like that aspect.I\\'ve been using Cast Iron to cook with most of my life, born and raised using Cast Iron and I have to say it\\'s really a great way to cook.  You need to understand it\\'s not Teflon, things respond differently but once you learn how it responds, it\\'s wonderful.  With time my pans are nice and dark and develop their own nearly non-stick surface.  Just a light cleaning after use and they are ready to go again.  The lids are interchangeable between the cook top pans (like this one), the cook tope ovens and the camp pans that have legs for use with Charcoal.  The similar sizing also helps with storing things since you can stack them nicely in your pantry.Things I prefer to cook in Cast Iron are meats and anything oily.  Fried items such as pancakes, French toast and eggs also work extremely well.  I do NOT like to cook things that need to be boiled such as rice or spaghetti in Cast Iron, use other pots for that.If you can find one of these at a garage sale or thrift shop, grab it up.  These can\\'t really go bad and will last a lifetime.  Clean it, season it and it\\'ll last you forever too.In order of how often I use my Cast Iron, I\\'ll list types, sizes and most common usesLodge 5-quart Dutch Oven (loop handles or wire bale) same size as 10\" camp oven; used for cooking meats and family sized casserolesLodge 10-inch Skillet; used for frying up breakfast, grilled cheese and much moreLodge 7-quart Dutch Oven; same size as 12\"camp oven; used for larger family mealsLodge 12-inch Skillet; used for frying larger meals and when camping or groups at homeLodge 8-quart Camp Dutch oven (legs); used for outdoor charcoal camp mealsThere are special Cast Iron cookbooks that have unique ways to use these pans and ovens too, give one of those a try and you\\'ll find many new and tasty things you never thought about cooking in a pan before!5 stars, you can\\'t go wrong with a cast iron pan.  It\\'s not for everything but it works well for certain types of cooking.',\n",
       " \"Cast iron is excelent for general purpose cooking, and Lodge Logic makes good stuff. Plus, the fact that it comes seasoned means it's ready to use straight out of the box.Cast iron is naturally non-stick, and so minimizes the additional chemicals that your food comes in contact with. Plus, the lack of an artificial nonstick coating means you can use a metal spatula or fork to stir and not worry about it reacting with the surface of the pan.It's not perfect for every situation, though. Searing and other fast-heat techniques require a thinner metal, so I still have a copper-bottomed pan around just for that. But It's in a dark corner of the kitchen, and the Lodge Logic is right on the stovetop.The only thing that holds it back from a perfect score is that, in my experience, the pre-seasoning is a bit shoddy. I lost the origional seasoning just a couple of weeks after getting the pan. Noticed the distinct metal-taste in whatever I cooked. But, of course, a couple quick coats of crisco, a couple trips through a hot oven, and it was back up to 100%.Every cook should have a good set of cast iron. Even, gentile heat is perfect for most every cooking situation. And it can be used as a very handy weapon in case of intruders or bears.\",\n",

This Lodge skillet is just too heavy. Its awkward to have to muscle this Lodge around the kitchen. Its painful to have to watch my smaller mother struggle with it. Simply put I would not recommend this skillet for most women its just too heavy, and could be dangerous if dropped.Still having said that this skillet is affordable, and the pre-seasoned coating is a plus. The skillet doesnt cook that well out of the box though, it takes quite a bit of cooking before it improves. So dont give up on it if you dont like the results the first time you use it.The bottom line is if you want a one handed skillet dont buy this. If you dont mind lugging this heavy thing around with two hands it cooks acceptably well.I'm not sure what modern cast iron ware there is out there today which doesnt weigh a ton but this isnt it.

As I got more into cooking and amassed a small army of cookbooks, I realized that every single one of my cookbooks assumed that I had a cast iron skillet for at least one recipe.  When Alton Brown used a cast iron skillet to make delicious looking burgers and tenderloin I noticed he used a \"Lodge\" brand skillet - so imagine my surprise (and delight) to find out how incredibly affordable a pre-seasoned skillet was!Yes, the care instructions make it a little more difficult to wash - but it\\'s not tedious and there is a lot of information on the web with tips to make the process easier.  I cook on an electric coil stove (no gas hook up) and cooking with the skillet has been a joy - once preheated, the heat is conducted evenly.  Certain foods (like fried eggs) are much easier when cooked on the skillet than in my Calphalon pans.While I\\'m not ready to ditch all my pots for cast iron, I am very happy that I did decide to add this to my collection.',\n",

       " \"These are fantastic, I actually learned about Lodge Cast Iron in Mexico. Went to spend a week many years ago in Mexico at the house of the family of a gal I was dating. Her mom had some Lodge, a big deep like 5 qt. or something and a couple of frying pans that her mother got as a wedding gift.On that trip I actually used one of the fry pans to do a grilled cheese and do some eggs I think. I remember that I was impressed and called them Henry Cabot pans so I would remember after the statesman, Lodge.That was 30 plus years ago, I am not sure I remember the gals name  I dated. But  when I saw this Gold Box Deal I had only a few minutes so I didn't read much and ordered it, and after I did I thought,  I thought I hope this is the same quality, and hoping it wasn't made in China. When I opened the box , which had big yellow tags HEAVY USE CARE, I pushed away the plastic air filled bags and attached to the handle was  an American Flag Tag , on the other side was a smaller flag WITH BOLD TYPE LETTERS, Made in the USA. I am approaching 70 now, and can remember when those three words appeared everywhere. I am planning on getting a smaller pan  soon.Maybe we can do something like in Finland, who has the best schools in the world these days, teachers must have a masters and teaching credentials,many teachers have been in business retired early and teach. I think they said even the head of Nokia teaches, and it is all neighborhood schools if the kids don't move they go all the way through school with the same kids.And the kids walk to school because it is only a few blocks away. And I am going to make a note on the will to make sure themom who makes  sure my place is clean gets the Lodge Pans. This stuff will last at least 120 years which is how long Lodge has made these things in Tennessee.I am not now or ever been employed or a represented either Lodge Mfg. or Amazon.

Once you learn how to cook with cast Iron all other cookware falls short of the bennies it offers. From heating up items, to full chicken dinners its the best. Holds heat a long time after cooking, gives even temp throughout pan. I just made chicken breasts that come out perfect eveytime. I simply place breasts in skillet season then place foil over it and put it in oven @350 45 min take off foil 20 min before done to crisp up skin. Other skillet I cut potatoes, onion, 1 pepper, little olive oil, season throw in oven for 45- 60 min and the pan browns and cooks a perfect dinner. Easy to clean I dont use anything else, even serve from skillet.Reheat pizza is the best!! Heat pan up full flame 10 min. Shut off heat under pan place pizza slice in skillet and cover and in 10 min you have slighly browned crust and just a perfect reheated slice, well worth the wait taste better then fresh to me. Since it hold heat so long will heat pizza brown but not burn it. I can go on and on of its used. If you use butter or spray before you cook even eggs dont stick. Once you learn how to get the pan to right temp nothing will stick. Frying is the best, burgers in the pan place lid and it will brown as they cook as well.Its all in learning how to heat and use pan since it holds the heat long, but once you master it nothing cooks food and can crisp food like this. Veggies are the best. Heat pan up good throw in veggies and cup of water cover the heat will steam them perfect then throw in butter as water evaporates butter covers veggies, makes them perfect.I also read that cooking in cast iron will supply natually iron into your diet, is it true ? I dont know. But for the cost buy 1 and try it experiment with it. To me it does not get any better.Plus they will outlive you if you season and take care of them and you can hand them to your off spring like Grandma did.

Great for baking cornbread or searing steaks on high heat.Cast iron is not nonstick (don't know where that came from). But a seasoned pan is virtually nonstick if it is maintained; i.e., kept seasoned. When cooking, you want to first heat your pan and then add oil or butter after the pan is hot.Never use soap on it; that is one secret to keep it from rusting. Only wash it out with water and leave the oil/fats intact. Dry it immediately with paper towels after use; then put it on a burner on low heat and let it sit for about 3-5 minutes, then turn off the heat. This gets any residual moisture out of the pan. Let it sit on the burner until the burner and pan are cold, then put the pan away. From time to time, season per directions.If you have never seasoned a cast iron pan, rub it lightly with oil, and place it in an oven at about 350F for about one hour. Remove it from your oven and let it cool on your stove top. Wipe away the excess oil with paper towels and store the pan for its next use.If you take care of it, this pan will last your lifetime.\",\n",

There is a good eight inch cover available for this, too. Fits perfectly. You, too, may learn to love cast iron cooking! Cleanup no problem. Just fill the pan with hot water after it cools a little after you finish cooking.

Then we can serve it directly at the table, one skillet for each of one and the heat from the iron keeps the food hot while you eat.We also have larger skillets that we could use and have people serve themselves from it, but the individual skillets make a much better impression.We'll be buying more so that when we have guests, each person still has one.The only complaint that I have with it, which I have about all Lodge Logic skillets, is that the surface is fairly rough, unlike some older (no longer in production) skillets.

This one was reasonably priced and pre-seasoned, so I bought it together with aT-fal E9180764 Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Expert Interior Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator Anti-Warp Base Dishwasher Safe 12-Inch Saute / Fry Pan Cookware, Gray, figuring that one or the other would eventually make a good replacement for my warpedRachael Ray Hard Anodized II Nonstick Dishwasher Safe 12-1/2-Inch Skillet, Orange. Almost everything about this pan was pretty much as expected. The cast iron is very flat and the pan retains and distributes heat very evenly. The trade-off is that the pan is extremely heavy, and of course, both the handles get blazing hot, making it doubly unwieldy. (I boughtLodge ASHH41 Silicone Hot Handle Holder, Redto solve part of the problem.) Obviously, the thermal properties of the cast iron are this pan\\'s big selling point, but I was not impressed with the \"non-stick\" qualities at all. I cared for the pan according to the instructions that came with it, and everything seemed to be working well. I didn\\'t wash the pan, instead opting to wipe it out with a cloth after using. Eventually, though, I tried to fry some eggs and that was the pan\\'s undoing. The eggs stuck quite stubbornly to the pan and after scraping as well as I could, I was left with no choice and had to wash the pan. After washing, I went to the Lodge website for instructions on re-seasoning the pan, and I thought I had followed them correctly, but when my pan emerged from the oven on the first seasoning attempt, it was sticky with a stubborn, baked in layer of dried oil. Now I\\'m left with having to scour, scrub and re-season (again) if I want to continue using this pan. In the meantime, the T-fal pan that I bought has become the kitchen workhouse. Nothing sticks to it and no seasoning is required.Cast iron makes great heirloom kitchen gear, but as good as this pan is for cooking everything but eggs, it\\'s a real chore to care for and doesn\\'t perform like pans with modern coatings. If you are a traditionalist with time on your hands, or you want to get a good bicep and forearm workout while cooking, this Lodge frying pan may be just the ticket for you. If you just want to cook food with a minimum amount of work and time spent maintaining your kitchen gear, I would recommend T-fal over this product. (That said, I went to the Lodge website, followed their re-seasoning instructions to the \\'T\\', and my pan is as good as new.

It's the first pre-seasoned cast iron pan I've owned.  I was skeptical about it and wondered whether I should look for one used or at least not pre-seasoned.However, the pre-seasoning works great, although after a few weeks of ownership I did season it myself, but this was because cooking at too high heat had damaged the pre-seasoning.  I'm totally happy with this little frying pan.  With proper care, there's no reason why someone can't still be using it a hundred years from now.Like all cast iron pans, it requires proper care. Here's how I keep my cast iron pans in good shape:1) If the pan is new and not pre-seasoned, or if it's been abused, I put it in the oven for several hours at around 100F with vegetable shortening covering the bottom of the pan.  If a pan's been really abused, you may need to clean it with oven cleaner, but this is a drastic step that should be avoided if possible.2) Always cook at low heat.3) Before cooking, allow the pan to warm up at very low heat with cooking oil in it.4) Clean it with a dry paper towel.If a dry paper towel doesn't completely clean it, use cold water and a sponge, but this will remove some of the pan's seasoning.\",\n",

Well, I made bacon and pancakes in it this morning and NOTHING STUCK!! I was sooo happy and the pancakes and bacon were DELICIOUS! Cleaned it with water and a brush, dried it, placed it on the burner for a couple minutes, paper toweled some oil on its surface and it\\'s beautifully black and ready to use tomorrow.

I have a small family, but like to cook a double-batch of almost every main course for leftovers, and this pan allows me to saute without boiling everything. As with all Lodge Logic pre-seasoned cookware, I gave it another coat of seasoning (peanut oil) and baked it in the oven at a low temp for a few hours before using it. It is just as easy to clean as nonstick. I wash it with hot water and a nylon brush, then put it back on my gas cooktop for a couple of minutes to heat. Once all the water droplets have evaporated I turn off the heat and give it a shot of Pam before letting it cool. I cannot recommend this pan highly enough. As far as storage goes, I have a warming drawer in the bottom of my range that accomodates this skillet and my two 12\" cast iron skillets just fine. I rarely use high heat with cast iron.

I kept it because who can't use a variety of skillet sizes?It wasn't 'seasoned' as much as I like, so I seasoned it again when it arrived.  If you've never used cast iron before, there may be a learning curve for you, but if you persevere you will figure out the best ways to use it.Overall, I really like the skillet.  It's great quality, reminiscent of the old cast irons my grandmothers had.  It beats the last skillet I looked at locally, which was made in China...I did not buy that skillet.

       " \"After waiting a month to get the thing because it was back-ordered, I FINALLY got to try out my skillet. I love this thing! Most of my cookware is garden-variety non-stick and hardly suited to things like searing steaks or fajita meat.You can run this pan as hot as you dare without hurting it - works great for steaks, and makes an awesome cheese steak. The pre-seasoned coating works as advertised, and the cast iron gives good heat transfer and VERY even heat across the entire pan. I think I'm going to be using this skillet A LOT.A handy suggestion regarding cleaning that I stumbled across on another website... be SURE to use a hot pad while doing this! Immediately after cooking, fill the pan with HOT water (not cold; you could crack it!), put it on high heat, and bring the water to a rolling boil... this will lift debris off the pan bottom. Dump the water and immediately wipe dry with a paper towel, set on the (turned-off) burner briefly to dry completely, and wipe the cooking surfaces with oil.Another note - want those steaks well-done but juicy?  Buy the Lodge Logic 5-qt Dutch oven; the lid fits this skillet!  Sear both sides of the steak on medium-high (about 3 min each), then flip, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook as desired, flipping the steak once along the way (about 5 minutes per side for a small, well-done filet mignon).  Your cooking times may vary, but the combo of cast-iron skillet for searing and lid to keep things moist while cooking works exquisitely.  Brown, not black, outside... and tender inside.\",\n",

These pans get better and better with use, and you aim for that \"black glass\" finish that another reviewer mentioned.  At that point you\\'ll get good nonstick performance.  Until that point, however, be aware that even the pre-seasoned cast iron is not going to give you the nonstick performance of a pan with a true nonstick coating.  I use my cast iron for as much as possible but keep a couple of nonstick skillets for frying hash browns and eggs because, frankly, my cast iron still tries my patience with those items.  I mention this so, if you do order this or some other cast iron skillet, you don\\'t toss out your nonstick skillets as soon as the UPS guy arrives with your new cast iron.

Even though I grew up in the late forties and fifties with my mother frying everything in her twelve inch cast iron skillet, I was a bit squeamish about having one myself. Add to that the seasoning process and long term care required, I passed for years. Well.... this skillet is great. The preseasoning was a big selling point as were the many positive reviews on Amazon. Upon receipt of my order which included the lid, I had to try it out. In short, the corn bread came out perfect and I have since used it to sear a pot roast which worked even better. I will be using this skillet more as time marches on and am pleased with the purchase. The only negative opinion that I have concerns the shipping. This item was poorly stablized in the box which caused the skillet and lid to come together causing a few scrapes. The damage was minor but could have been worse.\",\n",
       " \"I know I've got to give this pan a chance and only have used a couple times because my eggs stuck horribly both times. I'm hoping with time this will be as effective as my non-stick pan.\",\n",
       " 'I grew up with cast-iron (pre-Teflon days)and know the benefits.  I moved away from it with the new (at the time) non-sticks that made their appearances from time to time with new and better coatings.  I have reverted to cast-iron because of superiority.  I still use the non-sticks for casual and fast cookings but use cast-iron the majority of the time.  I love to cook and like to feel connected to my cookware (weird, huh?) Once they are seasoned properly (properly is key), they are very hard to beat for anything other than recipes that call for non-reactive cookware.  What the cast-iron novice needs to understand is that it takes a while for cast-iron to become the be-all.  One that isn\\'t familiar with cast-iron will expect too much, too fast.  With some understanding, that novice will have the patience to wait it out, so to speak.  The payoff is worth it. Without that patience and understanding, the newcomer will get become disillusioned and even disgusted and shove it to the back of the cupboard.First of all, the \\'pre-seasoned\\' is little more than hype.  Yes, any cast-iron does need to be seasoned but it takes much more than one introduction of \"oil to heat\" to achieve that seasoning. One has to cook several, if not many times in cast-iron for it to become indispensable.  After the first few times of cooking and cleaning the pan, coat the inside with an almost undetectable smear of vegetable oil and heat it up briefly on the eye.  Don\\'t let it smoke.  Allow it to cool down and wipe excess oil off.  There won\\'t be much because as the iron heats, it expands, allowing the oil to actually soak into the iron. When it cools, the oil molecules are trapped.  It prevents rust and makes the pot or pan easier and easier to clean the more it\\'s used.  Additionally, the initial roughness of the cooking surface itself will smooth out.  A patina will emerge from the scraping and stirring. This new surface will readily release food when you clean it. It is an eventual process but it will occur.  You will see it happening.  This will sound strange, but you will actually fall in love with it.  You have nurtured it to it\\'s present wonderfulness and will actually look forward to using it.  It becomes more than just a way to cook food; it becomes almost an integral part of the food being prepared.Again, don\\'t be discouraged after using it a few times.  Stick with it and follow the above instructions and you will reap enormous culinary rewards. It will make cooking an even more joyous experience.  If you don\\'t know how cooking can be joyous, maybe tolerable is a more operative description.',\n",

Then I cooked fatty meats in it for the first several times I used it. I made sure to preheat it to avoid sticking. When I got some burnt on food, I scraped it off and washed it as normal. I should have cleaned the pan by boiling some water in it to loosen the remaining food.

Just add the ingrediants and put a lid over it and set in oven and come back 1 hour later and it tastes as nice as a dinner at a high priced restaurant.Btw would recommend getting the lid that goes with this by Lodge too...but problem is it weighs as much as the pan..so look at another 5 lbs added to already 8-10 lbs of pan and food to lift out of oven.

So I decided to slowly build my own collection and I started with this monster. When it sits on the stove top it intimidates all of the other pans around it. A big, brooding high quality skillet with attitude. I also purchased the silicone handles for it as it stays hot for what seems like days. A great, great item it just does not have the family history of cooking infused in it like my mother's collection.\",\n",
       " \"This is an excellent product. The reviews that say otherwise seem to be mostly from people who are not familiar with how to properly care for cast iron. These do not rust if taken care of properly. Stuff doesn't stick if these are seasoned properly. I purchased cast iron after trying several brands of pots and pans. I found out the Teflon (and anything similar) is toxic and can be very dangerous if the surface is scratched. Others were not reliable in keeping food from sticking, no matter how much oil or butter I used. My mother and grandmother (and various aunts) used cast iron, and I'd never tried using it because I didn't want the upkeep that goes with them (you can't leave wet to dry, have to season each time, don't use soapy water, can't stack with other items, etc).  However, after having numerous frustrating experiences with other pots, pans, and skillets, I decided to fork over the money to get the cast iron that I knew would work, but is more work to use. I have actually found that using cast iron is less work in the long run. Especially if you season it well each time. I don't have to scrub food off that has been stuck on, because food doesn't stick on. Even things like eggs, which are notorious for sticking, are easily cooked and the slight sticking of any residue is very easy to just peel up with the spatula. You don't even have to use water to clean these. You can dry scrub with salt. If you do wash wet, you just use hot water and a brush, if necessary, and dry thoroughly (immediately, so it doesn't rust). Then, you rub oil into it, inside and out (which actually takes a lot less time that I had anticipated), and store it (preferably on its own). The great thing about seasoning is that it is automatically ready to cook with the next time you need it for things like stir-frying, saut&eacute; type stuff, etc. The oil is already on it and it's ready to go. The more you use it, the more well seasoned it gets, and the better the surface for non-stick appeal. If you care for this, it will last your entire lifetime and the lifetimes of generations to follow. They never wear out and I've never heard of one breaking or in any other way becoming dysfunctional. You can use them on a variety of surfaces, and they've done really well for us during things like camping, over fires...\",\n",

The sear you get with these pans is remarkable. I frequently saute mushrooms and fry up veggie patties, and I'm still enthralled with the perfect sear on the patties and the lovely browning of the mushrooms. Yum!One note: I personally recommend not cooking with olive oil in cast iron pans. The pans heat up more quickly and get hotter than my other pans, so the olive oil starts smoking sooner than I'm used to. And once it's smoked, it leaves a sticky residue in the pans, no matter how hard I scrub with a brush under super hot water. I'm sure others have used olive oil successfully, but I'm not always attentive enough to keep it from smoking and getting sticky. I've been happily using safflower oil, which is a neutral flavored, high heat oil that cleans up easily without soap.Bottom line: I love this pan, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who's willing to use and care for it properly.\",\n",

The seasoning they have on the pan will keep it from rusting and is good for greasy foods, but its not good to start with something like, say, eggs.  You will need to add additional seasoning to the inside of the pan for that.  I suggest starting off with something like bacon or sauteing onions, and then seasoning the inside of the pan only a couple of times before you attempt that fritatta or omelet you were super excited about.  Think of a pre-seasoning on a cast iron pan like a primer on a wall, you still need to add to it.  This pan is high quality and with proper care will last generations.',\n",

Cook in an oven holding 475 F for 25 minutes, then reduce the temp to 400 to cook until the chicken is done.

Remove the skillet from the oven, and you will have a golden bird, on a bed of potatoes that have been seasoned in all that lovely roast chicken juice. Some of them are going to be thin a crispy and stuck to the pan&#8212;I usually eat those before anyone else gets the chance.

I don't like non stick due to the toxic chemicals and you must always replace them, even the high quality ones that are expensive must be replaced no matter how careful you are with them. But cast iron lasts a lifetime, acts just like non stick and doesn't have anything toxic in them. =D Happy cooking!\",\n",
       " 'I have a 12 inch cast iron skillet that was a bit too big for everyday use, especially when making omelettes for my kids (small sized), so I ordered this skillet. It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I use it all the time: grilled cheese sandwich, omelette, melt butter, small quesedilla, etc. I really do wish Lodge made one between the 12 inch and 8 inch skillets, maybe 10 inch? Anyway, this size is great if you have small children or cook only for yourself.',\n",
       " 'This is the best all around pan to use for cooking. Keep it clean and seasoned and you can cook anything in it. I got this larger size so I could cook everything from pancakes to curry in one pan. It fits several slices of bacon really well. Clean up is easy, simply boil a  cup or two of water in it and then use a stiff brush to scrape off the junk. Then dry well, season and put away. The only drawback to this pan is that it is pretty heavy. I have to use two hands to safely lift it, and pouring out of it gets tough because of the weight. Also scratches glass cooktops, so make sure you lift it on a glass cooktop, never slide it. What a great skillet for the price',\n",

So far I have done, eggs, pasta re-heating, rib eye steak, and Italian roast beef in au jus re-heating.  I find that it gets a crisp coating on the eggs much better than a regular non-stick skillet.  Only downsides to the cast iron is it takes longer to get up to temperature and longer to cool down and its def heavier than a comparable size modern non-stick skillet. So far I have been able to clean it with just hot water and a sponge and once dry I give it a very very  thin coating of olive oil and store it.',\n",
       " \"I actually purchased this skillet at Wal-Mart for about 10 or 12 bucks. I forgot the actual price, but still not much for something that can last a lifetime and is made in the U.S.A. Really, we as consumers should try to buy as many American made products as we can when we have a choice. Of course, when it make sense to do so.So far this is a great skillet for small jobs. It says it's pre-seasoned, but honestly I think that's just to keep it from rusting at the stores. The real seasoning comes from usage. The more you use it, the better it will get.I have to say that I really love this skillet. It's usually found sitting on my stove because I use it so much. I pretty much use it daily.Here's a list of what I have cooked in this skillet: fried eggs (2), scrambled eggs (3), omelletes (2), fried chicken breasts, baked chicken breasts (2), chicken fajitas, beef fajitas, sauteed veggies (onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc), grilled ham & cheese sandwiches, grilled cheese sandwiches, and more!I have pretty much designated this skillet as my egg and breakfast skillet. It's the perfect size for frying eggs. There's smaller skillets, but personally I don't think they give you enough room. Granted, I haven't tried them but I think the 8 inch pan seems to be the best size for me.Here's a bit of advice on this skillet. Use it, and use it often. The more you do, the better it gets. If you want to use it fry eggs, then try what I do. I pre-heat the pan on low heat. On my gas stove, I set the dial on 2. Of course, stoves vary but hopefully that gives you an indication of how low I have it. Any lower, and you will hardly see a flame. It will take a bit to warm up, but it will definitely warm up good.Once it's ready, I coat the bottom and sides of the skillet with butter. If the butter burns and turns brown, then it's too hot. If it melts quickly and coasts the skillet without burning, then it's the right temp. Crack a couple of eggs into the skillet and let them cook until they are ready to flip. Go a head a give the skillet a shake when the eggs look just about ready to flip. I recommend the Lodge skillet mits for this purpose. Hopefully, your eggs will slide around. If not, then give them a bit of a nudge with a spatula. You might have to work underneath them a bit to loosen them up.Once you have the eggs sliding around, with a quick flick of the wrist you can flip them over. Or you can use your spatula, but that's no fun. It will also make you look like a pro if you can flip them with a flick of the wrist.If this didn't work for you and your eggs stuck, then your skillet just needs some mileage. The more you use it, the better it will get. Remember to wipe down and oil your skillet after use. That will protect the skillet so it can be ready for the next time you whip something up.Anyway, great skillet! I should buy another! LOL\",\n",

       " \"There are tons of ways people can season cast iron but let me share something I've yet to find anywhere: use a cotton, BBQ basting mop for seasoning. After you season this enough, you're golden. I make everything I can in mine & bought many other Lodge pieces after this one.1. I initially washed mine with baking soda & warm water because I didn't think it'd hurt. It didn't. Don't use any petroleum based soap on this!!!2. After thoroughly towel drying your pan, heat it on the stove. Get it hot & dry but not too fast. Start @ medium low heat. Why preheat on the stove? Cast iron is porous so it makes more sense to get the pores open so you can clog'em with grease. That's your seasoning.3. After it's hot, apply whatever grease you like. Sunflower oil worked best for me. If you see smoke, take it off the burner.Instead of using X many paper towels & burning your fingers, rub the oil into the pan with the basting mop. You want a light coating of grease but not too greasy. Mop can be washed & reused; & you'll never burn your fingers.4. Bake @ 300 degrees until it's nearly dry then add another light coating of grease.I applied 6 coats of grease then stopped seasoning. After the pan cooled, I heated it on the stove, added a little butter, & hardly any egg stuck. Yes, making eggs is the best indicator because it's simple & cheap. If anything sticks, just scrape it clean, or boil water in it to remove anything stuck. After the pan dries, season again. DON'T WASH WITH SOAP!!!!You know the pan's seasoned nicely by the sound your metal spatula makes. Initially, it sounds loud & annoying. After a good seasoning, it's quieter & smoother. I use my skillet everyday & don't regret the purchase 1 bit. Not only does it work well on the stove, but it makes a mean deep dish pizza in the oven. Works great as a baking stone too. Made in USA, nice price, & requires a little persistence. After that, it's all easy. Some say to just cook bacon or hamburger in it for a while. Yes, you can do that, but my way is cheaper, faster, & cleaner. Although, cooking bacon does smell good.Like a good roux, patience, focus, & passion work well here. Good luck.update: If you don't wanna fry bacon, use coconut oil. Makes the kitchen smell good too. I melted coconut oil, applied a generous coating, then baked it outside on my charcoal grill. Frying an egg is the best test, & I love it when the cheese easily lifts off the pan. Toasted cheese is yummy.\",\n",

       " \"As far as cast iron goes, this is about as perfect as can be. Although I always diligently season my cast iron pans after nearly every use, and could get away with a pan that wasn't pre-seasoned, I still think buying a pre-seasoned pan makes a lot of sense because you can get started cooking right out of the box. It also gives you a head start on your own regular seasonings--it takes care of those difficult first 3 seasonings for you.On my first use of this pan, I pre-heated the pan for 3-4 minutes, used a little canola spray (not much) and fried an egg. It slid around just as well as a nonstick pan! Amazing.Of course, what can I say about cast iron that hasn't been said before? It's just brilliant, and I use it whenever I cook meat these days--it just always tastes better. Lodge is as reliable and as inexpensive as I could ask for.\",\n",

It\\'s in constant use. For weekends, we make a big fry-up breakfast (yeah, not good for you, but once a week...) and do bacon, eggs, tomatoes and sausages. It\\'s great for any kind of frying, chicken, fish and you can even do a steak though I will say that this is a smokey process indeed.To pan-grill a steak, grease the pan lightly and sear the steak on each side, testing the meat for done-ness by pressing on top. Rare steak feels like flabby flesh. Well-done feels resilient. One clue is to test your hand; rare is the firmness of between thumb and forefinger, medium is your thumb muscle and well done is your wrist. Pinching these will give you an idea of how done your steak \"feels.\" When finished grilling, remove steaks to a warm plate and you can deglaze the pan with a swish of cognac or wine, add a swirl of butter for a very luxurious sauce.Washing this pan requires hot water..and no soap. If there are burnt bits, scrub them out with salt. Rub the pan dry. This keeps the seasoning from being removed by detergent and makes the pan almost as non-stick as a teflon pan, though of course not quite.',\n",
       " 'Sorry for the long review - for the short review, count the stars!I\\'m a bit of a purist. I always season my cast iron - new, or used (hey, I don\\'t know WHAT someone else used that old piece of cast iron for - maybe cleaning auto parts). I sand it down to bare metal, starting with about an 80 grit and finishing with 200.Then I season. The end result is a glossy black mirror that puts Teflon to shame. There are two mistakes people make when seasoning - not hot enough, not long enough. These mistakes give the same result - a sticky brown coating that is definitely not non-stick, and the first time they bring any real heat to the pan, clouds of smoke that they neither expected or wanted. I see several complaints here that are completely due to not knowing this.But there were a few pieces I needed (yes, needed, cast iron isn\\'t about want, it\\'s a need), and this was one of them, so I thought I\\'d give the Lodge pre-seasoning a try. Ordered last Friday, received this Friday - free shipping, yay!The first thing I noticed was the bumpy coating. The inside is actually rougher than the outside, and my hand was itching for the sandpaper, but that would have defeated the experiment. This time, I was going to give the Lodge pre-seasoning a chance before I broke out the sandpaper. So I scrubbed the pan out with a plastic brush and a little soapy water, rinsed well, put it on a medium burner, and waited. Cast iron tip number one - give it a little time. Then give it a little more time. Cast iron conducts heat much more slowly than aluminum, so you have to have a little patience.Then I threw in a pat of butter, and brought out the natural enemy of badly seasoned cast iron - the egg. And, sure enough, it stuck - but not badly, just in the middle. A bit of spatula work and I actually got a passable over-medium egg. Hmmm. But still not good enough. So I cleaned up the pan, and broke out the lard.I have only one justification for using lard. I don\\'t remember Grandma using refined hand-pressed organic flax oil, or purified extra-virgin olive oil made by real virgins. Nope, it was pretty much animal fat in her iron. A scoop of bacon grease from the mason jar beside the stove and she was ready to cook anything. Grandaddy wouldn\\'t eat a piece of meat that had less than a half-inch of fat around it. \"Tastes like a dry old shoe.\", he\\'d declare if it was too lean. In the end, I\\'m sure their diet killed them, but they ate well in the meantime. Grandaddy was cut down at the tender age of 96, and Grandma lasted till 98. Eat what you want folks - in the end, it\\'s pretty much up to your genetics.So I warmed up my new pieces, and smeared a very thin layer of lard all over them - use your fingers. Towels, especially paper towels, will shed lint, and lint in your seasoning coat doesn\\'t help things at all. Besides, it\\'s kinda fun.Here\\'s cast iron tip number two - season at the highest temp you think you\\'ll ever cook at - or higher. If you don\\'t, you won\\'t get the full non-stick thing, and the first time you bring it up to that temp you\\'ll get clouds of smoke from the unfinished seasoning. I put my pieces in a cold oven, and set the temp for an hour at 500 degrees (F, not C). Yeah, I know, Lodge says 350. Lodge doesn\\'t want panicked support calls from people whose house is full of smoke. Crank the heat up.You have two choices here. You can put a fan in the kitchen window and blow smoke out of your house like the battleship Bismarck under attack by the Royal Navy, or invest in an oxygen mask. You will get smoke. You will get lots of smoke, especially if you\\'re doing several pieces at once, like I just did. This is a good thing - that\\'s smoke that won\\'t be jumping out to surprise you the first time you try to cook with any real heat. The goal is to heat until you don\\'t get smoke, and in my experience, 500 degrees for an hour does that pretty well.Let the pieces cool in the closed oven. Then re-grease and repeat. And repeat again. And don\\'t glop the fat on. Just enough to coat. More thin layers are better than fewer gloppy layers. I managed four layers last night without my neighbors calling the fire department.Seems like a lot of work? Look at it this way. It\\'s a lifetime commitment. Treat your iron well, and it will love you right back like you\\'ve never been loved before. And this is pretty much a one-time deal, unless you do something silly.The end result of my all-night smoking up the kitchen exercise? Dry, absolutely no stickiness, black as a coal mine at midnight and shiny - but still bumpy - could it possibly work with that rough surface?I put the skillet back on a medium burner, put a pat of butter on and tossed in a couple of eggs. After the whites had set a little, I nudged them with a spatula, and they scooted across the pan. I\\'ll be... it works. My wife came back from the store and wanted scrambled eggs. If there\\'s anything that cast iron likes less than fried eggs, it\\'s scrambled. But it was the same thing all over again. No stick. No cleanup. Just a quick hot water rinse with a brush in case something got left on the pan (I couldn\\'t see anything, but hey), then I put it on a med-hi burner till dry, put a thin coat of lard on the pan and waited until I saw smoke for a minute. Let cool and hang up. Done.So. do I like the bumpy texture of the Lodge pre-season? Nope. Does it work? Yes, and contrary to my misgivings, it works very well. My wife pointed out that even some Teflon cookware has textured patterns in it. The Lodge pre-season isn\\'t a perfect surface out of the box - but it does give you a big head-start. After a night\\'s work, my iron is ready to face anything, and you just can\\'t beat that.Lodge makes a great product. For the quality, durability, and versatility, you can\\'t beat Lodge cast iron. Plus, it\\'s made in America. I like that. If you\\'ve never experienced cast iron cooking, you\\'ve just been cheating yourself. Plus, the price, for a piece of lifetime cookware, is insanely cheap.And my sandpaper is still on the tool shelf.',\n",
       " \"As much as I love and cherish my genuine (and no longer manufactured) Corning Ware Pyroceram cookware, it's just not the right stuff for making cornbread, or, more specifically, Johnnycake.What's the difference, one may ask?  Well, cornbread baked in glass or lightweight metal comes out with a soft barely formed crust.  Johnnycake adds the crackle of a fried crust, and the only way to attain it is with a cast iron skillet, like Lodge's Logic Pre-Seasoned 12-incher.Since it's pre-seasoned, it's like inheriting that coveted been-in-the-family-for-years skillet without waiting for someone to die. On top of the stove, nothing fries chicken better or makes crustier hash brown potatoes. Many gourmet chefs insist on cast iron for searing meats and preparing pan gravy or sauces, no matter how the meat is going to be finished. If you really want to see the family's eyes pop, serve up some plate-size pancakes for breakfast this weekend.In the oven, cast iron holds the heat better than anything else.  Scalloped potatoes bake up wrapped in crusty goodness.  Ditto for a pineapple or peach upside-down cake.But this pan really struts its stuff when you're in the mood for honest-to-goodness Johnnycake.  You start by preparing a double batch of your favorite cornbread recipe or mix.  While the batter rests, put your Lodge Logic skillet on the stove, lay in 2 or 4 strips of bacon and fry 'em up good and crisp.  Drain the bacon on paper towels and carefully tilt the pan until the sides are coated in bacon fat.  Pour off the excess and put the skillet in the oven as it preheats.When the oven's ready, stir down the batter, pull out the oven rack and dump the batter in all at once.  Listen!  Hear that sizzle?  That's the outside of your cornbread frying!  Close the door, let it bake and then cool it about 15 minutes before you turn it out on a cutting board.  Great Googly-Moogly, that's some fine eatin', especially if you sprinkle a little crumbled bacon on top of the butter and honey!You say you're a vegetarian?  Gotcha covered!  Melt half a stick of Nucoa margarine in the skillet instead of frying bacon.  Butter will burn at these temperatures and the delicate flavor will cook out, so save the butter for when your Johnnycake comes out of the oven.You could even use a cooking spray, but don't come crying to me if it's not as good.  I tried to warn ya.Oh, and here's a delicious bit of irony.  I just saw Emeril Lagasse making Johnnycake on Food Network.  Was he using one of his Chinese-made EmerilWare cast iron skillets?Nope.

By formulating the right metal chemistry, and creating the exact mold tolerances, they offer the finest line of cast iron cookware available.Lodge Logic is a revolutionary new line of seasoned, ready to use cast iron cookware that's even better than your Grandmother's. An electrostatic spray system evenly coats the entire surface of the iron with a proprietary vegetable oil prior to the cookware moving into very hot industrial gas ovens. The high temperature allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the cast iron surface creating that prized heirloom finish.It may not stop squabbles over the beneficiary of the family's cast iron cookware, but it does eliminate the time and effort of seasoning cast iron for the customer while offering the superior look and performance of home seasoned cast iron cookware.Lodge is a zero hazardous waste stream foundry. Lodge designed a vegetable oil recycler for the seasoning process to reduce waste and unusable oil is recycled and used as biodiesel generator. Lodge uses recycled and biodegradable packing materials. Reuse of foundry sand used in the casting process is recycled and unusable sand, working to purify the water of the local streams and planting trees to improve air quality and beautification.Care and Cleaning of your Lodge Cast IronAfter cooking, clean utensil with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. (Avoid putting a hot utensil into cold water. Thermal shock can occur causing the metal to warp or crack).If you are having trouble removing stuck-on food, boil some water in your pan for a few minutes to loosen residue, making it easier to remove.Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to the utensil while it is still warm.TIP: Do not let your cast iron air dry, as this can promote rust.Store in a cool, dry place. If you have a cover, or lid, for your utensil, place a folded paper towel in between lid and utensil allowing air to circulate. This prevents moisture from collecting inside the utensil, which can cause rust.TIP: The oven is a great place to store your cast iron; just remember to remove it before turning on the oven.NEVER wash in dishwasher.If for some reason your utensil develops a metallic smell or taste, or perhaps rust spots (maybe a well-meaning relative washed your utensil in the dishwasher or with soap thinking they were being helpful), never fear. Simply scour off the rust using a very fine grade of sandpaper or steel wool and refer to the section on re-seasoning at the lodge website.Don't be fooled by cheap Chinese imitations -If it's not Lodge, it's not Made in America.MADE IN THE USA.

The seasoning isn't.For you folks who've never used properly seasoned cast iron, if it's well seasoned nothing sticks to it. It's as good to much better than 'non stick' ware. It can be washed with detergent (keep it out of the dishwasher, though) though that's rarely necessary. Maintaining cast iron is little bother and the heat distribution is as good as ware that costs dozens of times as much.\",\n",

       " \"Cast iron is lovely to cook with.  It heats up well and holds heat beautifully.  Most cookware has trouble really searing a steak because the big slab of cold meat cools the pan down.  Cast iron sears like nothing else because it's big and heavy and holds heat very well.  This property can be a liability if you're looking to vary heat quickly, say when doing a delicate cream sauce.  Aluminum is better in that situation.  Iron is also very prone to rust - so you can't let it sit in sink with suds, or even put it away wet.  You have to clean up promptly, without soap and then dry thoroughly.  I've found a quick wipe with some oil on a paper towel and then drying upside down in a warm oven for a hour is perfect.  Keeps it seasoned and rust free.  The oiled surface helps the performance of cast iron cookware.  Is this a lot of trouble?  Not really - but it's a lot more trouble than my other forms of cookware.  Burnt on cheese makes some fairly permanent stains.My other beef concerns the longer of the two handles (the short loop is blameless).  The traditional handle is too short for a good grip on such a big pan.  I don't contest the indestructible and historically traditional shape of the iron handle - which is too hot to touch in use - requiring you to use some sort of handle sock or really tough pot holder.  The nail hole is dandy for hanging the pan (like from the buckboard of your Conestoga wagon while heading West across the prairie) - I just wish the handle were long enough to properly maneuver this big pan.Final conclusion - cast iron is a discipline.  It has certain unique strengths that are particularly well suited to fry pans and dutch ovens, for certain kinds of cooking.  I'm glad a I have some for that purpose.  I'm also glad I have some All-Clad for other more delicate cooking - and for easier day to day maintenance.\",\n",

Kind of surprsing. I'm not sure why this has been the case, but my husband and I have both noticed it. I have to say though, it is very different than cooking with a regular teflon pan. At first I kept burning everything. Cast iron gets very hot and maintains a steady hot temperature.

       " 'Lodge skillets truly are one of the last great bargains in cookware. I have several pieces in the Lodge Logic line, and they make my heart sing... the non-stick patina that\\'s developed over months/years of use, the substantial heft of each piece, the rustic beauty, and most of all, that unmistakable delicious flavor that only cast iron can impart.I recently added two of these 8\" skillets to my collection. I had been eyeing them for my daily single-sized omelets (I plan to wait until the skillets are a bit more seasoned before attempting to cook eggs in them), but every day I think of countless new uses for them. They are perfect for:- a single, perfect grilled-cheese sandwich- heating up last night\\'s left-overs- sauteing baby portabella mushrooms as a side dish for dinner- skillet creme brulee or blackberry cobbler with ice cream for dinner guests - each guest gets their own perfectly-sized skillet- quesadillas- huuuuuge, perfectly-shaped sourdough pancakes, made one at a time (or two at a time if you have two of these handy skillets!)- crepes- tapas... get several of these for several types of tapas and serve right in the skillet- French toast for one- baked brie- individual-sized frittatas or quiches- skillet no-knead bread or cornbreadand so much more... I really wish I\\'d known about these when I was single. I would have eaten so much better! But, they come in so handy as junior companions to my 12\" workhorse skillet and my two-burner reversible grill/griddle, I am happy to make up lost time with these little gems.At $10 and change, I recommend you purchase as many as there are members of your family. Or if you\\'re single, buy two... so you can impress dates by serving individual-sized appetizers or dessert! Then ask for two more for Christmas, so you can add a fun, gourmet twist to your dinner parties.As with all cast iron, even though this is pre-seasoned, it\\'s a good idea to season it again yourself before using. Generally you don\\'t use soap or detergent on cast iron (and NEVER put cast iron in the dishwasher!!), but when I first get a new piece, I hand-wash it with hot water and a tiny drop of mild dish soap. Dry it thoroughly with a dish towel... then, to remove any remaining water that has been absorbed, put it on the stove or in a hot oven for a few minutes so that any remaining water will evaporate.Then, coat with a *light* coating of grapeseed oil or organic vegetable shortening. Turn the oven on 400 (or higher, if you dare!) degrees. Put your new skillet into the oven upside-down and line the bottom of the oven with aluminum foil to catch any drips. \"Bake\" for 1-2 hours. Turn the oven off, then leave the skillets in all night to cool and solidify. Your skillet will have a deeper hue and glossy sheen that it didn\\'t have when you bought it. This will make it a bit more naturally non-stick. The more you use it (or if you want, you can repeat the above seasoning process), the more non-stick it will become.With proper care, cast iron will become your most well-loved cookware. I\\'m so excited to have added two of these 8\" skillets to my Lodge cast iron collection and can\\'t wait to come up with even more uses for these adorable, super-handy little skillets!',\n",

Note the extra handle on the front of the beast. It\\'s there for a reason. It makes the skillet manageable despite the weight.The second item to note is that this skillet is not dishwasher-safe. It requires special attention. That\\'s not unique in the world of cookware, but this one requires a little babying. I\\'ve found that the extra effort is minimal and not as mysterious as some of the reviews here have made it out to be. In short, just follow the manufacturer\\'s guidelines. They\\'re from people who know this product and they\\'re straight-forward.So with the negatives out of the way, I have to say that we love this skillet! We have cooked plenty of items in it and use it several times a week. Fried chicken, steaks, chuck roasts, you name it.For steaks, just crank up the heat to max, (we have a gas stove, so electric might be different), put a little oil, salt, and pepper on the steaks, and put them in for 3 minutes uncovered. Then flip and leave for 3 minutes. Then flip, turn off the heat, and cover for 3 minutes. Then flip and cover for 3 more minutes. That\\'s it. It\\'s all in the skillet and it comes out perfect. (adjust times for thickness of steak.) The thickness of the cast iron lets the skillet retain the heat and distribute it. With the lid on, it acts as a Dutch oven.For roasts, we start the same way, but searing the roast for 6 minutes in what Alton Brown calls a \"rocket-hot\" skillet. 3 minutes on each side, then cover it and slide it into an oven set on BROIL. Leave it there for 5 minutes/pound. (a 2-pound roast = 10 minutes.) Then turn off the oven and leave the roast for about an hour.  DON\\'T OPEN THE DOOR! Simple and delicious.About the only thing we don\\'t cook in this skillet is eggs. They do tend to stick. I have to think we\\'re doing something wrong since my in-laws cook eggs in theirs with no problems. Of course, they\\'ve had theirs since Lincoln was a toddler, and these skillets do seem to age very well, as long as you take care of them.Bottom line: If you don\\'t mind the heft and the extra bit of maintenance, this skillet will serve you well for years. And if you have kids you can inspire in the kitchen, this could become one of your treasured family heirlooms.',\n",

I think there\\'s a bit of nostalgia and obsession brewing with some of these reviews but honestly this pan delivers and from what I\\'m told, it\\'s a healthier surface on which to cook.  Growing up my folks had cast iron skillets that were just plain abused.  I know there was soap used, I know there was steel wool used and never did I see anyone \"season\" or oil them.  I actually like taking care of this pan and I\\'ve got everyone trained, if you use it, brush it, no soap dry it and spray a fine layer of vegetable or canola oil on it and put it back in the oven.

Follow the instructions and this pan will outlive all of us.  I bought the Lodge brush when I ordered this pan and I\\'m still using that same brush, it\\'s almost time for another but it\\'s a good buy too.  Make sure you educate everyone in the household on the care required for this pan.  It\\'s worth the effort, it\\'s not a big deal, they clean up easily.  It\\'s fun to use and it heats your food like no other surface.  My favorite thing to cook is simple breakfast potatoes, it browns them well and I use a lid from another pan set that fits perfectly.  I did see some people complain of the pan cracking in half and that should be considered a factory blemish.  If this were to happen to me, I\\'d return it for another one and chalk it off as a lemon.  My skillet has served me well and I\\'m going to buy a smaller one and eventually replace all teflon surfaces with cast iron.  Although I don\\'t think I\\'m quite ready to fry an egg properly, I will figure out a way without having to use nine cubes of butter. ;-)One thing to be aware of is the way cast-iron reacts with garlic and vinegar.  I was sauteing garlic one day and somewhere during the recipe I dashed in a little rice wine vinegar and my garlic turned blue.  It wasn\\'t the most appealing color as it reminded me of food-gone-bad but I read later its a natural reaction between the iron surface, the sulphur in the garlic and the vinegar.If you buy this pan, consider the slip-on handle pad and definitely buy the stiff brush from Lodge.',\n",

My mom never owned one, and I have never seen my friends using one, so I never bought one, but I have been watching the Pioneer Woman a lot on TV, and she uses them often, so I bought this one. It seems to be a great deal with the silicone handle cover. They sell some Lodge skillets like this at Walmart, but when I got this one today and lifted it, I knew those at Walmart are made to be lighter. This is one heavy pan! it must be like, 8 pounds or more! I can't hold it straight with one hand, so it's good it has the adjacent handle. I used it tonight and I already like how it cooks.\",\n",

In my case it was time to upgrade to a larger size to accommodate my family. This pan is a very nice size and the only downside to that is that it's difficult for me to lift it in/out of the oven one handed like I used to do with my old skillet. I use this primarily to make pan-seared steak, and it works perfectly for that purpose!I would definitely recommend this product!\",\n",

       " \"It's a monster and it's not even their biggest pan.  The only trouble I have ever had with cast iron cookware is getting the seasoning right.  Once that's been taken care of though, this thing really cooks.  My goodness I love this pan.  The only funny thing with this pan, as compared to all the others I have from Lodge is the bottom is slightly convex so oils and fats tend to collect at the edges of the pan.  Also, take care that this pan is not to big for you.  Your flame (or other heat source) should be about the size of the bottom of the pan.  My flame does not cover such a large area so the edges of the pan are not as hot as the center.  That's a problem if you're just cooking four eggs.  It gets tricky.  However, if you have a lot of material in there, what a great way to deal with it.  Lodge is made in the U.S.A. and is the best quality cast iron cookware made.  Consistency of material thickness, quality of manufacture and materials, all top notch.  If you like cast iron, and I really do (I really don't like eating Teflon) this is an outstanding pan for an outstanding price.  No, I don't get any money from Lodge or anyone else, I'm just a really happy customer of Lodge cookware.\",\n",

       " \"I use this skillet way more than anything else in my well-supplied kitchen arsenal. It's extremely versatile and cooks very nicely and evenly. For me, the benefit of cast iron is that it holds and distributed heat evenly. People have different approaches to cleaning cast iron - I personally use a brush and soap and water and just re-season the pan every so often. I personally put my pan back on the burner to dry it after washing to avoid rust. The price of Lodge cast iron can't be beat, but the low price doesn't mean compromised quality. I personally find the 12 inch size to be perfect for regular use as well, although I wouldn't mind a few in other sizes as well.\",\n",

Well, for the price, I like having this size -- I cook for one and it\\'s perfect for 2 pork chops.  To give you an idea of size, two pork chops fit perfectly in the pan, and 3 pork chops make it very crowded.Cast iron is as non-stick as it needs to be.  Chicken breasts, steaks, burgers, chops all turn out well when cooked in this pan because the pan holds its heat and sears in the juices.  That is what I use it for.  For eggs, and french toast, and pancakes I go to the Calphalon non-stick.Cleanup is a breeze.  I put water into the pan after cooking (after it has cooled down a bit), eat my meal, and then use a scouring pad without soap to clean the pan.  Then I heat the pan up a bit, put a small amount of oil in the pan when it is dry and hot and wipe it around with a paper towel, leaving a very thin coating of oil.For the price, [...], you can\\'t go wrong -- if you are cooking for more than one though I recommend the 12\" pan.',\n",

I am a small to medium sized female w/ skinny arms, but this skillet is not too heavy so I can still lift it w/ one arm. It's not really non-stick because the eggs won't easily slide off the pan like they would from a good new non-stick pan, but it's much much better compared w/ my stainless steel skillets. As long as you soak the pan in water after cooking, by the time you finish your meal, the food residue can be easily washed off with a brush or sponge. I use a nylon dish brush with hot water and cleaning is very fast and easy. I never use soap or steel wool. Leaving a bit grease on acts like re-seasoning. This is the same way I take care of my carbon-steel wok. The only complaint I have is that the handle is way too short. The skillet is relatively heavy but even with my small hands it still feels as if the handle only fits half of my palm, so it forces your hand to hold it really close to the hot pan - really bad design. Though I use it everyday and find it indispensable, the short handle alone is why I am unwilling to give it a five star rating.\",\n",

These ones from Lodge are pre-seasoned, so you're ready to go as soon as it arrives. Some people like to do an extra seasoning coat anyways, but I didnt bother and it made no difference.My first attempt was to fry a ribeye by pan frying it quickly on each side and then puting it in a high temp oven for a few minutes to finish it (for the recipe I used Google - Alton Brown's cast iron ribeye recipe). It came out GREAT. While my steak was resting, I quickly scrubbed my pan with some warm water and salt. (no soap) I was susprised how easily the gunk came off just with scrubbing some gritty sea salt and water. I have a separate sponge which I have now dedicated to be my &#34;no-soap&#34; sponge... I then oiled it a bit after cleaning but before putting it away.My 2nd attempt was some quartered red bliss potato's which I baked in the pan at 500 degrees with just oil salt and pepper. They also came out great. Again, I scrubbed and re-oiled my pan while it was still warm.Im pleased with how easy it is to clean, and how mine has already turned black and shiny, and non-stick.The trick is to follow the care guidelines, these things rock.I think I might get a 2nd one so I can do steaks/chops and sides at the same time.5 Stars.\",\n",

The more I read, the more I am convinced that cooking with these synthetic pans may be dangerous to health.I used cast iron for years and only quit because I heard it destroys vitamin c. Well, better to destroy vitamin c than to cause cancer from fumes of god-knows-what coming out of synthetically coated pans! Vitamin C is cheap and we take quite a bit of it every day anyway.The one drawback of this pan is that it is SUPER HEAVY! Wow! My wife needs two hands to move it from the counter to the stove! Unless you need one this big I might suggest a smaller one, maybe 10&#34;.What I love about this pan is that it is pre-conditioned. The last cast iron pan I bought (which is a smaller one), I had to condition it myself and it took time and effort. It's not difficult but it does take time. For the money I think this is a better deal and I used it right out of the box (after washing it with mild soap and drying it). It worked great as I knew it would - cast iron is cast iron, as far as I know - that is, any cast iron will give you about the same results if it is made well. This one is made well.Again if you need one this big, go for it! If not, get a smaller one. What I like about the big one is that it can be used for smaller things, whereas a small one cannot be used for bigger things.One thing I'd like to see is an option to get it shipped with a fitted leather or silicone handle pad as if you cook on higher heat for a while the handle WILL GET HOT. I do have a handle pad somewhere, that I used with my old (smaller) cast iron pan, I just have to find it. But it would be nice to have a fitted silicone handle. Does anyone make one? I'll have to check.But ALL cast iron pan handles get hot and I suggest you buy a handle pad and get in the habit of using it. Otherwise, grabbing a hot handle once or twice will teach you the hard way to use one!\",\n",

The more I use it, the better the food tastes. I also made an attempt to watch some how-to videos off YouTube, which helped tremendously as well (Alton Brown has some handy ones on there).When I first used these, food did stick quite a bit, despite using oil, so I decided to start applying oil after each use. I now am in the habit of rinsing/scrubbing when I\\'m done, I dry it down and then heat it back up on the stove as I apply a thin layer vegetable-based oil, which seems to make it more non-stick.

Pre-heat oven to 350, and apply a thick- EVEN- coat of shortening, with white paper towel, folded in half ( so it does not break up).  all over the pan, inside and out, and place on cookie sheet, face down, and let the pan bake for 1 FULL hour.  Remove from oven, for 10 minutes, and repeat the process 2 more times. Then let final cool down, and wash with rag, a a little dish soap, OR USE A MILD SCRUB BRUSH ( NYLON, NOT COPPER) ( no scrubbing, or immersion), just simple sink wash, and NEVER  put CAST IRON, that is NOT enameled, in dishwasher.  Lodge is still better than most foreign imports. However, it's not the lodge of the 1920's-90's. I mean many of the pans are not even BLACK. But it's still a good price, and cost per use over a lifetime. Just needs a little more care than our Grandma's Lodge.AND PLEASE DRY IMMEDIATELY, WITH A TOWEL.

In all other respects, the pans are equivalent. The surfaces of both are nearly non-stick, and the evenness of the temperature, heat-retention, and durability make them far preferable to teflon-coated non-stick pans. For searing of meat and other high-temperature cooking, there is nothing that can compare to cast iron. This size is perfect for so many uses; its quality and durability make it a bargain.

On the blog at Mary Lou Cheatham's Profile, you can find the most delicious cornbread we have ever eaten. It is Cathy's Crawfish Cornbread.  To find it, it is necessary to go back to an older blog.  Here is another cornbread recipe  developed with our Lodge skillet:Butter Pecan CornbreadIngredients1 stick ( pound) unsalted butter1 cup chopped pecans1 tablespoon canola oil1 cups self-rising cornmeal mix1 cup self-rising flour teaspoon baking powder1 cup milk3 eggs, beaten2 tablespoons honeyPreparation--In a small saucepan melt the butter with the pecans in it.  Don't burn the butter, but let the pecans cook slightly.  Allow them to cool.--Heat the oven to 450.  Heat the skillet with the oil in it.--Combine the dry ingredients.--Add the remaining ingredients.--Spoon the batter into the hot skillet.--Bake 10-12 minutes.One of the problems people seem to have with the skillet is sticking.  Since I use it to cook cornbread, I usually heat the oil in it in the oven and pour the warmed oil into the cornbread batter immediately before pouring it into the skillet.  As a result, it never sticks, and the cornbread has irresistble crust.  I have sprayed it generously with Pam(PAM-Original No Stick Cooking Spray, 3/8oz Cans) to cook other foods and had great results.Every meal we cook would present some opportunity to use the iron skillet, but we don't use it every day because we have become leery of cooking a large amount of our food in iron.

So when I read the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I wanted something I could make single-serving egg dishes in for myself. Well, I LOVE this. It is, indeed, rough (not smooth) on the inside, but I have a feeling that this is a GOOD thing. It comes pre-seasoned (vegetable oil), and I seasoned it before first use with canola oil. I rubbed it, heated it, and threw it in the oven to keep it clean. Then I baked something, and left it in there. Finally I used it for scrambled eggs. NOTHING STUCK to the pan! Then I got brave and cooked a cheese and jalepeno omelette. NOTHING STUCK to the pan! In fact, I can put a 3-egg and cheese mix in the pan, let it set on a medium burner for a few minutes, put the stainless steel/walnut spatula (sold on Amazon) under it, flip it intact, turn off the heat, then just flip the pan over and drop it out onto a plate. NOTHING STICKS! And I cannot say that for my older teflon pan from a big-name anodized aluminum maker. At all.So when you wash it, use a plastic brush and warm water... not even hot. Then rub a little vegetable oil on it, and put it into the oven and let it reside there the next time you bake. OR just heat it on the burner and let it smoke.BIG TIP FOR CAST IRON AND STAINLESS PANS: Let them heat up BEFORE you add any cooking oil as you first start to cook. Things will not stick. If you add things to a cold pan, they will very likely give you problems.\",\n",

It wasn't until the last few years that I discovered the joys of cooking with cast iron - both with Le Creuset enameled cookware and this fabulous Lodge Logic cast iron.I use cast iron to cook nearly everything - It's heat retention and even cooking is superior to everything - including stainless steel - I have a few stainless steel pots, as well as cast aluminum - and nothing beat cast iron.This skillet, in my mind, is a must-have for any kitchen.  Anything you could use a skillet or frying pan for, you can use this.  I've made the best homecooked steaks in this pan, phenomenal burgers, incredible fish, sauces, braised meats, you name it.

If you're not familiar with it, it's totally different than your standard stainless or non-stick cookware.Being a nerd, I did a lot of research before I invested in cast iron and am glad I did. Don't be fooled by the idea of this pan being pre-seasoned; you'll need to put in some upfront work to get good results. If you're looking for a low maintenance pan, this isn't it. Caring for cast iron isn't onerous, but there is some continuous care needed to keep your cast iron in good shape. If you do, you can expect it to last for year, decades even.Google Sheryl Canter and Chemistry of Cast Iron; I followed this method and had no issues with food sticking from the very first use, cornbread mind you.I also recommend investing in some steel wool, coarse salt, and a sturdy brush (I use bamboo). The steel wool is good if your pan rusts, the salt is great for cleaning residue and the bamboo brush is excellent for tough stuck on food debris. My only other piece of advice is to let the pan cool before getting it wet to clean it.I would definitely by more Lodge products, this one doesn't disappoint.\",\n",

I have a full set of All Clad stainless frying pans that are somewhat non-stick if you know how to use them.  I've heard so much about Grandma's priceless iron frying pan that I had to give it a try.  Compared to stainless, iron heats up slowly but keeps the heat much longer.  The pre-seasoning isn't much because real seasoning takes years.  This is beacuse the iron is rough and only through use become smooth.  My complaints relate to the handle: First it is too short so you can't get a proper grip and second it gets hot enough to burn you (unlike stainless).  I guess I'll get used to these problems and learn to appreciate the ultimate cooking surface that iron provides.\",\n",

Every size of pan requires some amount stirring because of hot spots. And yes, this pan also requires food to be stirred. Every few minutes or so, I even moved it slightly over the flame in a triangle fashion. The cast iron held its heat very well.

They turned out great, and everyone was served hot hash browns at the same time! And one benefit of the large size is that I did not have any hash browns falling out as I stir (I commonly over filled my smaller pans).

       " \"I already own a 12-inch Lodge Logic pre-seasoned cast-iron skillet but always found it too large for a lot of applications, too heavy, and too slow to heat up properly.  So I was debating on whether to purchase this 8-inch skillet or the 6 1/2-inch, and I'm glad I purchased this one.  This 8-inch skillet is perfect for making individual omelettes or cooking up smaller batches of vegetables, potatoes, etc.  Since the 8-inch diameter refers to the lip of the pan, the actual cooking surface is smaller than 8-inches so I can't imagine getting the 6 1/2-inch skillet for anything other than a novelty item.On one last note, the pre-seasoning is actually not too bad and I was able to make some great eggs on my first use without them sticking.  Everyone here has their different way of cleaning cast-iron so I'll add mine: after cooking and when the pan is still hot/warm, sprinkle in about 1Tbsp of kosher salt and rub this around the pan with a paper towel to scrape away any thing that's left in the pan.  The salt acts as an abrasive and works pretty well.  Dump out the salt (careful, it'll be hot) into the sink/trash, then add a little bit of cooking oil to the pan and spread it around using the same piece of paper towel.  That's it.

I bought the lodge 8\" for a few dollars more than the Amazon price (didn\\'t check beforehand).  My mom had a 12\" cast iron frying pan that she constantly used when I was growing up.

Use a stiff kitchen brush if needed.3. NEVER wash in a dish washer4. NEVER leave it wet...it will rust!5. Put about a teaspoon of cooking oil on a paper towel and rub the oil all over the pan after you towel dry it.6. This thing retains heat so take that into account when cooking.7.

Well I bought this pan and it hasn't been that great for me.  For one thing, stuff tends to bake in and create a rough texture that is hard to clean.  It isn't that smooth slick carbon that everyone else seems to rave about, its just burned food on the bottom.  Second, the surface of this pan is rough. From reading on the web, apparently until the 70s cast iron skillets were machined inside to a smooth finish, but the interior these days is left pretty much the way it comes out of the iron casting.  I've tried seasoning the pan in the oven with the techniques you can read about on the web, in Alton Brown's books, etc and nothing has given me a smooth slick surface on the bottom.  Call me disappointed.  I know this is a minority opinion, swamped by all the people that just love this pan, but this has been my experience with it.\",\n",
       " 'Having used aluminum and steel pans ever since I started cooking, I\\'m thrilled at how much better food turns out when cooked on this pan. Steaks are seared much better, hash browns and fries are crispy outside, tender inside. It\\'s like my taste buds were asleep all this time. I guess I thought that that ranges for home use just weren\\'t hot enough to get restaurant quality food. I don\\'t think enough people know how good cast iron is to cook with and settle for substandard cookware like I did.This pan is heavy and pretty much indestructible, unlike non-stick pans that have limited useful lives. It\\'s also free of potentially harmful non-stick coatings. Though it comes pre-seasoned, before using it, I washed it and baked it at 200 degrees for 2 hours after spreading Crisco on it (lard is supposed to be even better for this). After this, it is 99% stick-free and the seasoning will just get better with time. The cast iron retains heat much better than steel or aluminum and spreads heat more evenly, which provides superior results, even when using a lower flame. I also love the fact that this pan can last several lifetimes. This pan (or any Lodge product) is an excellent value and something every household should have.Since I got this pan, however, I learned about the advantages of buying second hand cast iron such as Griswold or Wagner, made from the 1850s to the 1950s, and I picked up a couple myself. These pans are superior to modern Lodge pans (or any other current cast iron ware), but they will also be a bit more expensive (approx $50-$60 for an 11\" pan online) and usually need to be restored and re-seasoned, which requires some elbow grease. They are much lighter (about half the weight) and have a smooth, machined cooking surface, whereas the current Lodges have a rougher, pebbled surface (they stopped machining the surfaces at some point to cut costs). In my experience, the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface doesn\\'t significantly impair its non-stick properties, but the smooth surface of my antique pans is far superior and much nicer to cook on. With the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface, it\\'s not as easy to smoothly slide a stainless steel spatula under foods and it\\'s noisier, whereas with the old pans, a spatula glides effortlessly under foods. Like many things, cast iron cookware with the quality of the old days just isn\\'t being made anymore and will likely never be again.For price, performance and easy availability, however, I don\\'t think anything beats Lodge.',\n",

Learn how to maintain this pan (oil after every use, don't wash with soap only hot water, etc.) it will give you great non-stick performance.  If you are getting foods to stick on it after a week of breaking it in, you are not maintaining it properly.  I have also heard of additional benefit of these pans adding iron to your diet.

       " \"**** UPDATE 2 ****I'm still learning how to use this wonderful pan.  I've stopped cleaning it out in the sink.  I just leave it on the burner and clean it in place regardless of what I did with it.  I use Pam spray (not the old kind that leaves a residue), butter or olive oil while cooking, wipe it out with dry and wet paper towels immediately after removing the food, and recoat with spray and leave it on the burner to cool.  In most cases I can clean the pan so quickly my food is still hot when I sit down to eat.I now use it about as often as my nonstick skillet, although it's horses for courses.If you broil steaks indoors in winter, try this: Lay some foil in the pan and shape it to fit.  Remove the foil.  Heat the pan on the burner until the oil starts to smoke.  Drop in the foil, drop in a steak or two and put the pan under the oven broiler.  Turn the steak as usual.  The steak cooks similar to how it would on a gas grill and cleanup is a matter of just lifting out the foil. Bend the foil to drizzle the accumulated juices over the steak.UPDATE***I've grown to like this pan more and more.  I now cook meals in it.  For example, at breakfast you can cook eggs, hash browns and bacon at the same time.  It's all about the timing of when each ingredient goes in.  If you are diligent about keeping it well-oiled and don't put food in until it's pre-heated, the pan behaves as if it were non-stick.I wish the main handle was longer.  The pan is so heavy it's hard to move around when cleaning.  It's much easier to clean if you do it while it's still warm.  I pretty much have to leave it on the stove and wipe it out with a bunch of wet paper towels.ORIGINAL REVIEWI bought this after getting frustrated trying to cook sea scallops in a regular pan and not getting a good sear.  This is the kind of pan you need for searing meats on a stove or in an oven.It's got a rough texture finish inside.  Be sure it's hot and has oil or butter on it before adding food to prevent sticking.  It cleans easily with just water and a sponge if you let it soak for a little while.  If you clean it with soap you need to heat it and rub oil on it to restore the seasoning coat that prevents the food from welding onto it.It's really heavy!  Imagine holding a skillet with sand in it.  They've added on a handgrip on the opposite side of the handle so you can use two hands.  If the pan is warm (and it stays warm long after you turn off the burner) you'll need potholders on both hands to move it to the sink for soaking or cleaning.I'm still experimenting with it, but I think it makes a great addition to the kitchen.  I use it much less often than my non-stick Circulon skillet, but it lets me do things I never could before and that's sparking my creative juices.\",\n",

Cost was about the same just had to pay for tax, so like ~$3 more.Wanted to smooth the cooking surface a bit more, this what I did:First used 150 grit sandpaper and finished with 400 grit wet sandpaper. Just on the cooking surface, to sand down/remove any high spots. One can sand even more[mirror like finish], but this was enough for the skillets bought and not really necessary.Wash well with soap and a scouring pad or similar. Rinse/Dry immediately and throughly, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillets.Then re-season the skillets. Place them in the oven at 500F upside down on the top rack and with aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch drips. For 1 hour, let it cool down for ~30 minutes and repeat the re-seasoning process 3-5 times to get them well seasoned again.First time use was great. Cooked some sausage and scrambled eggs. The eggs did stick a little, but that is to be expected; as more seasoning/cooking is done that will be a thing of the past.For cleaning one can use a scrub brush as suggested or salt.

Health benefits also.  Will be using these for the rest of my life.  Lodge is also USA made!\",\n",

Like one of the other reviewers, I initially tried it out with eggs, right after receiving it...definitely stuck to the pan.  I started to cook all my greasy food in this pan, and after about a month, it improved significantly!  Today, I fried eggs with only a little cooking oil (same conditions as with my teflon frying pan), and to my surprise, the eggs didn't stick!  My husband actually asked me to fry another one for him!  I'm VERY happy I bought this, and will continue to use this for a long time.

It bubbles up & when the water settles down, I pour it out & nothing is left sticking to the pan, although I still use the Lodge Logic cast iron brush on it while under hot running water.

About Eight Pounds empty. Those with weak wrists and arms need not apply. Two hand hold required.Tips:You must have goot pot holders, as the uninsulated handles will get hot when cooking.Don't scrub hard as it removes the seasoning.Don't let it air dry, it will rust.Don't put it in the dishwasher, as it will remove the seasoning.Leave it a little oily after you cook\",\n",

       " \"I bought this because a good friend who was visiting put my 100+ yr old skillet in the dishwasher.  Yes, I cried & it was all I could do not to wring her neck.I love this skillet now, but straight from the store the preseason was worthless.I have the fancy corn bread pans and their large reversible griddle.  These items came seasoned and none worked like that antique pan I thought was ruined.Another friend asked me to her camp house and she said bring all your cast iron you want to season, because you'll be doing mine as well.This is what I did.Scrubbed all of it using Dawn.Dried it with flour sack towels, I buy from Sam's Club.Put all the cookware on the campfire so it was definitely dry.Pulled out of the campfire, waited for it to cool enough to handle.Grabbed my bucket of lard, yes I said lard.  Greased everything with a medium coat. The inside should show the white grease.Put all of it back on the campfire for about an hour, right side up. Pulled it off to cool again. Started the process over again.Once I felt the insides were right, I flipped every thing over and started the process again.It did take most of the day, but I saved my 100+ yr old skillet.If you can't get to a campfire, a gas or wood burning grill will do it as well, as long as it has a lid.If you don't like the idea of lard, a good friend uses shortening.  She buys the generic version.  I use lard because I'm 4th generation using my antique skillet.  I guarantee they didn't have vegetable shortening.I do not recommend the cactus cornbread stick pan.  13 yrs of using & I still can't get those puppies non stick. My reversible griddle is great on the grill and camping, but not on my electric coil range. It doesn't heat evenly and it's a pain to clean.If you get your cast iron seasoned properly, it will be heaven to use and last forever.  If you don't, cussing will happen.Washing it, properly seasoned is a breeze.  Usually a swipe with a paper towel.  If stuff has stuck, a green scrubby and hot water.  Worse case scenario, use some dish soap.  If you feel the need to use soap and water definitely put in on a burner for a few minutes to make sure it's dry and then use your vegetable oil of choice to smear it in every nook and cranny.Finally, spoke with a Lodge representative.  Took me forever to find a phone number.  They have never responded to my emails.  My impression is they know, the seasoned Logic stuff is going to give you fits.  They just don't care.The customer service person I did speak with did say, even the Logic needs to be seasoned 3 to 5 times.She did tell me if you put it in your oven at 400F for 2 hours it will take off their stuff.  After you've used some steel wool and soap to wash it first.I think they do a huge disservice to the joy of using cast iron. I understand why they season it. They want the folks who didn't grow up with it, to try it.  Sadly, they don't do it well.Getting it right, is still the same as my 3x great grandmother did it and it requires patience.\",\n",

       " \"As person who loves to cook I love anything that makes cooking easier.  So when I first got married, I wanted stainless steel everything.  I bought a beautiful set of stainless steel T-Fal cookware.  I quickly learned that stainless steel is not the way to go unless you want to be best friends with Pam (the cooking spray) or if you use a lot of cooking oils (butter, grease, shortening) in your foods.  So I bought more T-Fal, this time I purchased 2 non-stick skillets for my daily usage.  I learned a short time after purchasing that non-stick fades.  Suddenly I started finding little black chips in my eggs and the interior of the skillet had all kinds of scratches as the non-stick coating was peeling.  I did some research and found this is a common occurence in non-stick cookware.  And it will happen to every item sooner or later.  I also found that the little non-stick chips are toxic.  Well, that was enough for me.  What else is there?  Cast Iron.  I decided to buy an iron skillet for the health benefits as well as the longevity of the cookware.  How many grandmothers, mothers and aunt have a cast iron skillet from 20, 30, years ago?  Pretty much every cook I know.  So I knew going into the purchase that this would be a long term investment of time.  But after 3 years... it was all worth it.I cook pretty much everything in this skillet.  From eggs to fried chicken to alfredo sauce to grilled cheese sandwiches.  This is my go to skillet.  The only thing I dont cook in this is anything with tomatoes or tomato sauce.  The acid from the tomato just kills the nice non-stick loving I have going in this skillet.  Besides that its a perfect size for large and small meals.I've heard of different methods for cleaning and seasoning an iron skillet.  As much as they say that this skillet is pre-seasoned, it is not non-stick yet.  You have to do that work yourself.  Personally, this is what I did when I first got it.I used it for everything!  Eggs, baked chicken, fried foods, burgers, pretty much anything you can cook.  You have to actually USE it.After I cook in it, I cleaned it with only HOT water and a really really tough nylon scrub brush.  Sometimes, I would sit and scrub that thing for what seemed like hours.  Sometimes, it took an overnight soaking in hot water to get out baked on lasagna.  Never use dish detergent or put it in the dishwasher.  The soap with eat away at the non-stick layer you're slowing building up.Either way, after you clean it, dry it completely with a towel.  Not a paper towel because the surface of the skillet will scratch away little fibers from the paper towel and you'll have small white things stuck to your skillet.  Place the skillet on the stove on high heat and use a small bit of shortening and very, very, lightly grease the interior of the skillet.  I have an old cotton dinner napkin that I keep specifically for this purpose.  Keep it on the burner and let it heat up until you see the skillet begin to smoke.  Turn off the burner and let the skillet sit while it cools.Over time, using this method every time will get you that nice non-stick layer.  Of course, this layer is just shortening or cooking grease building up and baking into the skillet.3 years into this, I don't have to season it like this anymore.  I just cook on it, wash it with hot water and my scrub brush and dry it completely. Good luck with this method.\",\n",

It works well for baking in a toaster oven, too.As with all cast-iron pans (even if they're pre-seasoned) expect eggs to stick the first time you cook them on it. After you've cooked eggs a few times (with plenty of oil), they shouldn't stick in future. Pretty much everything else seems non-stick from the get-go, though.Anyway, this is a great first pan.

I ordered this skillet thinking the bigger size would be good to cook for my large family and I was right, but when I say it\\'s big I mean it\\'s MASSIVE (and heavy!). I wiped it down with some flax seed oil and put it into my heated oven and it fit with very little wiggle room. It certainly will not fit in my cabinets so it will have to live on my stove-top which is just fine by me.A lot of reviewers have complained about the \"rough\" finish on the inside of the skillet. To me, it doesn\\'t seem that rough. There is a definite texture to it but nothing that will totally destroy the integrity of your food, in my opinion. Don\\'t let a little texture steer you away from buying this bargain-priced skillet - you can always season, season, season to get that smooth patina cast iron is renowned for.One thing to note is that the product picture indicates that there are two pour spouts between each handle. My skillet does not have the pour spouts. That\\'s slightly disappointing but this skillet is so heavy that I doubt I will be able to gracefully pour anything out of this thing, pour spouts or not. Amazon should update its picture of the product.All in all, I am thrilled with my beast of a skillet. The size is great for my large family but if you aren\\'t cooking for a bunch of people I think this skillet may be overkill for you. Try a 12-in or even a 10.5 in. skillet.Edit: I just received the 12-in rooster pan as a gift and I am thrilled! The rooster design adds a homey touch to our otherwise contemporary kitchen. I use the 15 inch skillet every day but it takes up so much room on my stovetop that it is difficult to cook two things at a time.

But then again, lots of things would be perfect if it were just a few inches longer.I will probably buy a few more of the same pans in different sizes.

Fried chicken, eggs, bacon. YUCK! Whip out with a paper towel was just not enough for me.When I use this pan, I let it cool completely.

The pan is CLEAN and not greasy.I then spray it lightly with Pam, and put it in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes, then leave the pan to cool in the closed oven. To store this pan, I keep it underneath of my stove (I have the broiler at the bottom of my old fashioned stove) on top of the broiler rack set far from the flame, covered in heavy foil to keep out dust.

Everything was sticking a LOT, so I just seasoned it with shortening (Google if you don't know how - very easy!), coating the whole pan (and putting a foil-covered cookie sheet below to catch drippings. The first few times, we made sure to cook fatty foods (bacon, ground beef), but now it is seasoned really well so we can just use a bit of spray and make anything - grilled cheese, french toast, veggies - whatever.

Easiest tip ever!). Rinse, dry and then I pop it back on the stove top on low for about 10 minutes to get any remaining water out (which I learned was critical after a little rust spot appeared).

I ended up with a sticky residue and one pan rusted.  After about three attempts of scouring and reseasoning, I gave up and ordered three Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned skillets.It is fanstastic.  It worked like a charm with the first use -- no problems with sticking at all.  I actually smiled while making my burger!  My cornbread was also back up to Southern standards thanks to my 10-inch pan.The 10-inch works well for cornbread and frying.  (Acutally cast iron is the only way to make good cornbread.)  I use the 8 for single burgers.  The 6 I bought out of habit, but it also works well for single burgers.Clean up is relatively easy.  Wash with hot water; Lodge does not recommend using soap.  Dry thoroughly.  I then heat mine on the stove top, turn off the heat, add a tablespoon of oil and use a paper towel to spread the oil on the entire pan inside and out.  After the pan cools, I wipe away any excess oil and store the pan.For anyone who wants a head start on leaving heirloom cast iron pans, I strongly suggest this product.',\n",

These pans are clearly good quality heavy duty iron, and they are quite easy to cook with. I was worried the 8&#34; would be a little small, but it has ended up being my go-to pan for a lot of things - the perfect size for heating up corn tortillas, frying side dishes, sauteeing veggies, etc. The 12&#34; I have used less since I generally am only cooking for one or two people, but it's a nice size for a bigger batch of something if I were cooking for friends and family - would be great for making a big batch of home fries or something similar. 10&#34; might be a more versatile size for everyday, depending on your needs, but I like the option of the 12&#34; since I like to entertain.\",\n",
       " 'I have been cooking on cast iron for over 20 years. For those unfamiliar with cast iron, you simply dont know what your missing. The flavor is second to none and they are practically indestructible. I only have 2 10\" skillets and I have wanted to buy some new pieces for quite some time. In particular, I have wanted to buy a 12\\' skillet, a dutch oven, and a griddle. I was actually hesitant to buy from Lodge based on the price being so low. How often does something like that happen? Anyways, after doing an ample amount of research I decided to pull the trigger and I ordered 2 pieces, this skillet and the LPGI3 Pro 20\"x10-7/16\" Grill/Griddle. To say I am impressed is a massive understatement, especially when you consider the price. Lodge cast iron could very well be the best deal going in the entire cookware market. I certainly cant think of its equal, at least not that has this price point.My biggest concern was with the pre-seasoning. Its not that big of a deal as seasoning cast iron is very easy but I didn\\'t know if that was something I was going to have to do or not. I was pleasantly surprised. These pans really are ready to go right out of the box. Cast iron has never been this easy. The first thing I cooked was eggs and the flavor was just as good as my 20 year old pans, something I wasn\\'t expecting.For those new to cast iron, just remember a few simple rules and your pans should last forever. When cooking, bring the heat up slowly and if your using a 2 burner griddle make sure you heat both sides evenly even if your only using one side. In regards to cleaning, always hand wash with a stiff nylon brush. Never use detergents or soap and always use hot water as rinsing a hot cast iron pan with cold water can actually cause your pans to crack. Follow these rules and your pans will most likely outlast you.Bottom line - I am absolutely blown away by Lodge Cast Iron. The quality is amazing, the price is amazing and the pre-seasoned pans are literally ready to go right out of the box. Again cast iron has never been this easy. For those that have never tried it, what are you waiting for? At this price point what do you really have to lose? I will be recommending Lodge Cast Iron to everyone I know, right after I order a few more pans.5 Stars and then some!!!',\n",

If you need one that the handle doesn't get hot on, look at the newer ones with a stainless handle.Advice:No soap, wash gently in warm water, or you'll remove the seasoning and stuff will stick.Wait to wash, if you try to wash it while it's hot, you will most likely crack the iron.Reseason from time to time.Overall:A hundred years tells the story, your kids kids will be using this pan.\",\n",

Clean ups without soap are a surprise, but effective followed by wiping dry and a light spritz of oil.  Often it only needs a wipe off.  Maybe soap is what spoiled my cooking experience in th past, leading me to give away my old skillets to my daughter-in-law.  And it is heavy, almost too heavy for this senior citizen.

       " 'I have 2 pieces of Lodge cast iron cookware. This one and the 12\" un-preseasoned skillet which I conditioned myself. I have to add my voice to the chorus of cast iron admirers who don\\'t know how they ever survived without their Lodges. I do about 80% of my cooking with one or the other. Steaks, burgers, any type of sauteed chicken recipe, stir-fry, fajitas, cornbread, bacon and eggs, pancakes, french toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, and on and on.Cast iron\\'s chief strength comes from its massiveness. It is basically a honkin\\' big hunk of iron formed into a cooking utensil. This large quantity of metal, once heated, will tend to evenly distribute its heat and stay hot no matter what you put into it. Futhermore, once properly conditioned (which Lodge has done for you here), they are almost as non-stick as teflon.Unfortunately, cast iron is not without its faults. Its greatest strength may also be its greatest weakness in that it is significantly heavier than other types of cookware. This skillet weighs about 6 lbs. Imagine trying to pick that up, plus the weight of whatever you\\'ve cooked in it, with one oven-mitted hand so that you can use a spoon in the other hand to help maneuver your recipe into a serving dish or storage container! If you have weak hands or arthritis or any condition that limits your ability to pick up and manipulate heavy objects, it may not be a good choice for you.Also, iron will rust if not maintained correctly. Lodge provides you with use and care instructions which are not complicated or difficult, but which you MUST follow to the letter. Read the instructions carefully when you get your pan. No dishwasher, no soap (just hot water and a stiff brush), dry quickly and coat with cooking oil.I\\'ve read some reviews where folks are saying that you can\\'t cook tomato-based or acidic products in cast iron. Though it may be true, I\\'ve never found an authoritative source to corroborate this and, in fact, Lodge\\'s website (lodgemfg.com) offers recipes that contain tomatoes and acidic ingredients! I regularly put tomatoes, tomato sauce, wine, lemon juice, etc. in my cast iron and haven\\'t seen any ill effects from doing so.These pans are so inexpensive, it will cost you very little to give them a try. If you do, you\\'ll be singing their praises with the rest of us!',\n",
       " \"I deliberately waited to review this product, because there are so many reviews which praise or dismiss cast iron within a few days or weeks of them using it for the first time.  So please take this review from someone who had the patience to experiment with the pros and the cons.Personally, I feel that cast iron, in general, is fantastic, because it will last for several life times if taken care of properly.  In addition, it doesn't have Teflon, which is becoming a constant concern for those who know better.Pros:It is durable for decades, if not centuries, IF CARED FOR PROPERLY.It distributes heat more evenly.It retains heat longer than other cookware.Once well seasoned, it almost takes care of itself.If you have a recipe that requires you to start the meal on the burner, then transfer it to the oven, this is perfect, since you don't have to worry about some plastic or silicone handle grip melting in the oven.  Just remember to have an oven mitt when handling.Cons:It's heavy.  People with arthritis, or some other physical impairment may have a problem with its weight.There is a learning curve, which takes some getting use to, because of the fact that it retains heat more evenly, and retains it.Un-learning how to clean your cookware can be counterintuitive.  Don't soak it, don't use soap, and don't scour it.  (It removes the seasoning that makes cast iron so great and virtually nonstick.)The 10.25 inch skillet is deep enough, in my opinion, to be more of a pan, and not a skillet.  This is the one item that I bought later than any of my other cast iron purchases, but it is the one pan that I use more than anything else.  After a good 8-9 months of use, it almost maintains itself.  I've even gone so far as to bring it to a family cook out, and told no one to touch it or clean it.  I didn't want them to get burned from the heat retention, or ruin it with soap and a scouring pad.  And regarding it's cleaning, I strongly recommend AGAINST getting a fancy 8-12 dollar scrubber.  Realistically, while the cast iron will probably outlive you, these cleaning brushes will get gunked up rather quickly.  Even high pressure water blasting can only clean these to a certain, but not total, degree.  So I recommend getting one from a big box store, or even a dollar store.  I go through one of these every few months, and spending 8-12 bucks on one of them is simply nonsensical.MY BOTTOM LINE:  If you're willing to put a little more time in cookware that will take care of your culinary needs, as long as you take care of it, then buy this.  Yes, you'll have to do some small amount of rethinking how you cook, but ultimately, anyone who is passionate about cooking will appreciate cast iron.  But, if you want a light weight, easy to maintain even for a five year old, then cast iron products may not be for you.I'd appreciate any questions or comments, so please feel free to ask me anything about cast iron products.  And if I was helpful, please give me a positive vote, and of course, I'll address your comments and concerns when you post them.Thanks for taking the time to read my review.\",\n",

Hooray!Preseasoned pan with no teflon.  Coat with olive oil after each use and you\\'re good to go.  The problems with teflon are well known, but manufactures persist in using this toxic material to make pans non-stick.

I repeated the same coat'n bake, and leave over night to cool. then the next thing I cooked was  peach cobbler and had no problem with sticking. The pan has a glassy coating after two treatments and two uses and does not have to be treated again. Now after rinsing with hot water (no soap) I dry it with a dish towel, rub a dab of oil around it before putting it away. Canola oil works better than olive oil for the treating because it can take the higher temp and is thinner.I can't go 5 stars because the pan is heavy...but that's the nature of cast iron...takes two hands to lift.I also have an enameled Le Creuset skillet but I like the straight sides of the Lodge better.

I have to admit, I was not attracted by the look of the pan, but did not want to shell out large amounts of money for the higher-end enamel skillets.  At under $20, I could not justify not trying it.  Wow, am I glad that I bought this pan!  It sears meat like a dream, but still keeps it tender!  On my nonstick pans, if I tried to sear meat, they turned out tough and dry from overcooking.  My onions and garlic cook up beautifully without looking burned.  I have not had mine long enough to be able to cook an egg without having the egg stick, but my rice no longer sticks when I make fried rice.  (I once had an aluminum wok that was well seasoned from years of use and I could cook eggs without them sticking, so I know one day, I'll get that with this cast iron.)  Seasoning is easy.  After I clean the pan with hot water and a brush, I dry it with a towel. I then use a pastry brush and brush a little oil on the pan, put it on the burner and turn the heat to medium high.  I let the pan sit until it stops smoking, let it cool and the pan is ready for its next use.  The smoking is not an awful acrid, burning smell so I'm not bothered by it.  I just turn on the ventilation fan and that works well enough to keep my house from looking and smelling like I burned bacon.

       " \"Cast iron cookware has excellent heat retention properties and can be produced and formed with a relatively low level of technology. Seasoning is used to protect bare cast iron from rust and to create a non-stick surface. And, in the past ten years the popularity of cast iron pans has increased every year. It is reasonably priced, easy to cook with and the food  tastes delicious. The most popular, and it seems, the last producer of good cast iron pans is Lodge. Based in Tennessee, the company has a superb reputation.Cast iron cookware needs to be seasoned and 'barefoot Bob' who has a popular review here seems to know the ins and outs, so follow his instructions. As reported this pre-seasoned pan tends to stick,,and with the use of any acidic product like tomatoes,the seasonng will go with the wind. Thus is the perfect pan, heart resistant handle that can and should be removed in hot ovens. Once seasoned, cook to your heart's delight, and then wash with water,mdomypu if you like. The perfect pan for the perfect meal.Recommended. prisrob 06-30-14\",\n",

       " 'The pan had a pit (-one star), surface is not super smooth and like other reviewers have said the preseasoning is a joke.  Still, my love is undaunted.  Seasoning is easy.  After cleaning with hot water and a scrubby brush, I just place it on the stove on low, and rub some on the surface with a paper towel. Easy cheezy lemon peely.  Makes the best fried eggs and fried rice. For my Chinese compatriots, you can get a nice wok char off of this baby. I love that I can turn the electric stove up to high and watch the pan smoke, unlike those fancy schmancy non-stick Circulon and Analon pans that have a max of tolerance of med high.  I don\\'t care what they say about their magic heat conduction properties, medium high on non stick is NOT the same as high on a cast iron. Still using a bit of oil before cooking things so not yet non-stick, but it makes cooking a joy. For the first time, the puppy lingers by the kitchen when Mommy\\'s cooking. Bought for just under $19 for a 12\".  It\\'s a beautiful thing.  Seriously contemplating the 7 quart dutch oven to get a lid that will fit both the 12\" skillet and the 7 quart dutch oven.

       " 'I\\'ve been using Lodge cast iron skillets for many years and I\\'ve found they\\'re in fact \"pre-seasoned\" but never to my standards. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars since I don\\'t feel they do a good enough job of pre-seasoning and they play up the pre-season aspect when they market these pans. I wish they would give full disclosure and make it very clear to people that a truly well seasoned pan can\\'t be achieved in the factory because most consumers will confuse \"pre-seasoned\" with \"well seasoned\" and then will expect the same degree of non-stick from pre-seasoned pans that you can\\'t get until or unless it is well seasoned (which can take 10 to 30 uses).Properly pre-seasoning any pan is simple as long as you have a large oven. These instructions also work perfectly for carbon steel. Carbon steel has been long used to make woks and is now becoming popular in making fry pans and skillets. Just remember carbon steel is fragile and can shatter like stoneware if dropped or mishandled, but make great natural and relatively light-weight non-stick cookware.PRE-SEASONING ANY CAST IRON:Heat your pan. This opens the pores of the metal so it can absorb more oil than if it were cold. Be careful, it will be hot as you handle it.... Coat the hot pan liberally inside and out with lard or vegetable oil (must be oil that can be used in high heat frying). Some people also use Crisco or peanut oil. I prefer to use organic corn, safflower, or sunflower oil. I do not recommend using any oil that is not designated for use with high heat as it will cause burning and give off gases that are not good for you to breathe in.... Coating \"liberally\" means use MORE than enough to wet the entire surface, enough so the oil soaks into the pores of the metal until the metal cannot absorb any more oil. Then and only then do you wipe off any excess oil that may drip or cause dripping. This does not mean wipe it completely dry, just make sure there will be no dripping of excess oil once you put it in the oven. Now place your skillet/pan upside down in your oven at high temperature (300F to 500F, your preference, I like 350F for cast iron and 450F for carbon steel) for at least one hour. This bakes in a \"seasoning\" that protects the pan from rust and eventually provides a stick-resistant surface. Be sure to place a sheet of aluminum foil under the pan or on a lower rack, to catch drippings. Let cool to room temperature in the oven.... In my opinion doing it this way is much better than the thin layer of oil sprayed on at the factory. Doing it this way at home makes it more \"non-stick\".CLEANING CAST IRON:Cleaning affects past and future seasoning. Seasoning is not done just at the start, when the pan is new. Seasoning is done every time you use your pan/skillet. Seasoning is done every time you add oil, either when cooking or after cleaning. Seasoning is also done while cooking, as some foods add to the non-stick of the pan and to the flavor of the foods you cook over the years. To preserve and create better seasoning you must clean your cast iron correctly, never using soap. And re-season (dry, heat, and oil it) periodically. I coat my skillets with a thin layer of oil after I clean them - every time I clean them. I clean them with hot water and a very stiff brush, I dry with a cotton towel, heat up to make sure all the water evaporates, add a thin coating of oil. Only then do I consider it ready to sit until the next time it will be used. Just cleaning it with hot water and drying with a towel is not enough, in my opinion, because residual water that soaks into the cast iron can cause rust, even though you can\\'t see it. This will eventually cause sticking.USING CAST IRON:I coat my cast iron pans with oil after cleaning AND just before cooking. I coat it with oil then wipe the oil out. As long as you wipe it out the small amount of oil that clings to the pan will NOT have an adverse effect on your health (if you\\'re trying to avoid cooking with oil). This small amount of oil is just enough to help keep food from sticking. It does this by filling the pores of the metal.The whole idea of seasoning is to make sure oil is absorbed into the pores of the metal, not that you need the oil to cook your food. You can use extra oil to cook your food if you want, but with a well-seasoned pan very little added oil will be needed. I know of no pan that comes seasoned that much. It\\'s always a process of using the pan over and over that gets it to true \"non-stick\". The more often you use and season your pan the smoother the surface will get and the more non-stick it will get. Be patient. It can take 10, 20, or more uses (with proper washings and proper seasonings) before you see a nice smooth surface that is truly non-stick. You\\'ll know you\\'re achieved great seasoning when small drops of water or oil roll around in your pan like drops of rain on a well waxed car.PS) Some say frying a cup or more of chives in oil in your newly seasoned pan will help it become slicker faster (enhancing non-stick properties). Rub the chives into your pan as you fry them. I\\'ve done this with my carbon steel wok and it was fabulous - super slick and non-stick. It will also make the metal darker, and this will tell you it\\'s getting better seasoned.* For full disclosure:I did not buy my 8 inch Lodge skillet from Amazon but I wish I did. I\\'ve purchased other Lodge skillets through Amazon and directly from Lodge, but I was in a hurry to get this 8 inch pan (I needed it that day for a dinner party) so I purchased from Fred Meyer and I paid over $16. I wish I was not in a hurry because I belong to Amazon Prime and I would have gotten it for $10.97 and free shipping which is cheaper than getting it anywhere I know of, even cheaper than getting it from Lodge.',\n",

I also bought the 15&#34; and 6&#34; pans. The 15&#34; is too big for my stove and way too heavy to hold in one hand. The 6&#34; pan is light, but a little too small for many cooking jobs.

A tiny bit is fine, but the char and coating of the skillet add to the flavor of the steak.2) Don't use soap to clean this.  Just water.  It's a bit harder to get the grease out, but it will be fine.3) Finally, allow the item to completely dry and wipe it dry.  I made the mistake of not doing so and the cast iron can quickly rust.  In most cases, the rust can be scrubbed off, but after a few times it can definitely be an issue and I bought a new one.4) These are great for placing in ovens.  But they get very hot.

Finally, after using this skillet 8 times and cleaning it properly, food no longer sticks to it!! It works as if it was a teflon skillet, so now I'm happy with it.  The proper way I was told to clean it was let it cool after use (obviously), use a Scotch-Brite sponge and warm water to clean it, then use a paper towel to absorb all the water from its surface, then lightly coat the entire inside with olive oil (or whatever oil you like to use) and let it sit this way until you are ready to use it again.  This procedure seems to work perfectly!  The only con about this skillet is that it has a rough surface on the inside, Lodge could have made this a lot smoother than it is, but overall doesn't seem to matter too much as, again, it now works like a teflon skillet.

This is probably the best-priced cast iron pan you can find, and it's working great for me so far. It comes pre-seasoned and is fairly simple to keep seasoned if you follow some guidelines. Avoiding metal scrubbers and harsh soaps (including dishwashers) is good advice since both can remove the seasoning. Lodge's website recommends washing with no soap if you know your pan got hot enough to sanitize anything on it, but they do say mild soap can be OK if you're really concerned about it. I've usually used no soap myself. They also recommend coating with a light coat of vegetable oil after each use (but I've seen some people recommend against this in case it turns rancid, though if you use it frequently it may not matter). Basically, I recommend following the manufacturer's instructions if you've never used these before since they might be different from what you're used to.One note: the entire pan is cast iron, including the handle. Since this is not insulated, you'll want to remember to use a pot holder or slip on a silicone or other protective pan handle cover on it. These pans are also somewhat heavy, but there is a small grip on the side opposite the handle as well, which helps to lift then pan for pouring or whatever (again, you'll need a potholder). There is a lip/spout on side of the pan that can help with this, although I've never cooked something liquid enough for it to be useful for me. I've used mine exclusively on the stovetop, but they are also versatile in that they can be used in the oven or just about any heat source (campfire, etc.) except a microwave.In summary, this is a great pan, and it's quickly become my favorite skillet. It is a bit heavy (hard to lift with one hand while trying to scrape the contents into a bowl, for example), but that's the case with pretty much any good cast iron pan and something I'm learning to work around better.

If food is allowed to cool in it and it is stuck on, it is still easy to clean with hot water, a stiff brush, and a little elbow grease. I would give it five stars but I've noticed all of my newer Lodge cast iron pans are not exactly flat like the old ones. They aren't horribly misshapen, but liquids and oils do run to one side despite my stove being level and that means the pans themselves are not level.  They are very useable but since they are not entirely level, they do not deserve five stars.\",\n",

       " \"TL;DR version - The skillet is awesome, it cooks everything from dutch babies to searing meat without any sticking or hot spots. No kitchen is complete without a cast iron skillet.------Now that's out of the way, if you haven't cooked with cast iron you're missing out, and you've also got a lot to learn, so here's a crash course to help figure out if this skillet is right for you.Advantages of cast iron:* cast iron has a high density, thus is retains heat extremely well* it's great at distributing even heat* properly seasoned cast iron can perform with the best non-stick pans* they are built to last longer than you, many are passed down generation to generation* you could rearrange a home intruder's face with a good swing of a cast iron panDisadvantages of cast iron:* unseasoned cast iron will rust quicker than you imagine* takes longer to heat up than your nonstick or steel* will probably crack if thermally shocked or dropped* they are heavier than any other type of cooking vesselA lot of the disadvantages of cast iron are easily addressable with a bit of common sense. First and foremost, cast iron has to be completely seasoned. This means the cooking surface, the bottom, the handle, everything. The good news is, this is pretty easy to do and the more you use the pan the better your seasoning gets.Seasoning your cookware:There are many discussions as to how to properly season cast iron. A recent post on lifehacker sums them up best. Basically what everyone agrees on is the vessel is covered in a layer of fat, and is put under high heat until the fat polymerizes. You let the pan cool, and repeat until you have multiple thin layers of polymerized fat. The discrepancies are what type of fat to use, the baking temp/time, and the best practices to maintain your seasoning.Traditionalists will argue that lard is best, because that's the way it always has been done. I've seasoned with bacon fat, and I'm a big fan of it. It satisfies the inner animal in me and makes me feel I'm cooking in the manliest way possible without putting a whole animal into a fire - not that I'm insecure about such things. I've also seasoned with vegetable oil, and found that it produces almost identical performance that lard does. The food science crowd suggests using flax seed oil, because it polymerizes easiest. I haven't had a chance to try seasoning with flax seed oil, but it's what I plan on doing after my next move in a few months. Another point to bring up, is that cast iron used to be offered polished and unpolished. The Lodge skillet comes unpolished, meaning it has a textured surface. I think before I do the flax seed oil seasoning, I will likely use a dremel/sandpaper to smooth the cooking surface purely for aesthetic purposes to flaunt that I take care of my cookware. Polished cast iron does offer the benefit of more exposed internal pores, so the seasoning sticks better, but I've never had an issue seasoning so this point is moot.I've done both high heat and medium heat for seasoning, and I find that the hotter the oven the better the seasoning. If you fail to season above 350f, you will likely end up with a browned pan that is slightly sticky because the fat didn't form a polymer, and will make you leave an unnecessary low star Amazon review and never know the benefits of cast iron. My suggestion is scrub the skillet with steel wool and soap until the water runs clear and you're sure there's no soap remaining on the cast iron. Dry the skillet completely, and cover with oil; make sure you get the handles, bottom, and top. Place a cookie sheet below the oven rack to catch any drips so you don't burn the house down. Heat the oven to 400f to 500f and put the skillet in there and bake for an hour - not including the preheating time. Putting it in a cold oven may be unnecessary, however this is the thermal shock downfall I mentioned earlier. It's better to get into the habit of avoiding massive temperature changes so you can pass the skillet down to your children's children. After the hour, shut off the oven and allow the skillet to cook down. This initial seasoning layer isn't quite ready for primetime, if you were to cook something with tomatoes, lemons, vinegar you could very well screw it all up because of the low PH reacting to the thin layer of fat polymer and possibly penetrating all the way to the cast iron. Too much science for me, so to be on the safe side if I'm going to be using the oven with temperatures in excess of 375f I make sure the cast iron gets another layer of fat and gets re-seasoned. Usually after about 3 or 4 trips to the oven, it could withstand just about anything.Now that you're seasoned, how do you not screw this up? First and foremost, I use metal utensils on it because it inevitably makes it easier to clean if stuff isn't stuck to it for very long. Providing you're not trying drill for oil through the pan, the polymer should be hard enough to not flake off and ruin your day. Next, make sure you invest in a large thing of salt. I don't think it's anything chemical about salt that allows it to clean the pan, but it's an edible scouring powder. I've read that because we generally don't use dish soaps that contain lye, they should be gentle enough to use on cast iron. I cannot confirm or deny this, because I find just using salt and a bit of oil to make a paste works just as well. Get a paper towel and polish down the dried bits of food until it resembles how it started. It may not have the same shine, but you should be completely drying the skillet and applying a real thin coat of oil to it. There's your shine. It's important to continuously use the skillet to maintain the coat. This doesn't mean every night, but treat yourself to a steak for dinner or pannekoeken for breakfast once a week - your skillet and taste buds will thank you.\",\n",

       " 'I have been a big fan of cast iron for awhile now, and have had this Lodge Logic pan for about 4 years. I have used pans from several different cast iron manufacturers, but after watching a video on their manufacturing process, I favor Lodge Logic over the others. However, there are two main problems I have with this pan.1. Handle is too short.  The handle on my 8\" cast iron pan is larger than this one.  This is a big pan, and the handle needs to be 1\" longer, and .5\" wider to be able to easily maneuver this very heavy pan, especially when you consider that people will be wearing oven mitts, which leaves even less room. If you\\'re not going to move the pan around much, it\\'s not a big deal, but people who don\\'t have strong forearms will probably have a problem with this.  It is just way too short and thin for a pan of this size. As you can see, there is a hook on the opposite side of it for hanging the pan, however if you have something heavy in it, it\\'s best to hold the pan from both ends.2.  The pre-seasoning is worthless.  As soon as I got the pan, I followed the instructions, which only consisted of rinsing in hot water.  Then I put it on a burner and set it to medium high to preheat. I have been using cast iron pans for a long time.  I have three other cast iron pans that are beautifully seasoned, and I have self-seasoned cast iron at least 20 times.  I know how to care for these pans and how to use them.  Within 5 minutes of putting this pan on my stove, the middle of the pan started to turn grey, meaning that the seasoning was burning off.  Within 15 minutes on medium high with nothing in the pan, the seasoning was completely burned off and I was left with a grey pan.  I then had to take a drill and sanding pad and remove all of the manufacturer\\'s seasoning, wash it completely with soap, then re-season the entire pan (properly).  Once I did that, it was fine. I would suggest that anyone who gets this, season it first a few times before cooking with high heat. You can do this by coating it with vegetable oil and putting it in the over for a couple hours, or just cook some bacon and sausage in it a few times and it should be fine.Aside from the handle problem and this, it is a great pan and I\\'m sure I will have it for years to come, but don\\'t trust the manufacturer\\'s seasoning and do it yourself.Some of the accessories I use with mine are:Lodge Set of 2 Durable Polycarbonate Pan Scrapers,Red and Black- These things are great. I struggled for years with trying to clean the pan without soap and without scrubbing off the seasoning patina.  These little scrapers allow you to get rid of stuck on food.  You can then put the pan on low or medium, drop some kosher salt into it, and put a folded up paper towel over the salt mound and use it as an abrasive to scrub off any other food and clean it. When the paper towel is no longer dark black, you\\'ll know you\\'re done.  Wipe it out once and coat with a thin layer of vegetable oil while the pan is warm.  Then lay a paper towel inside it and it is ready until next use.Lodge Max Temp Handle Mitt, Black- A handle mitt is great for leaving on the handle, which will get very hot.  This way you don\\'t have to worry about forgetting to pick up the pan with a towel or oven mitt and accidentally burning your hand.Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Rectangular Cast-Iron Grill Press- Use this for flattening out your bacon or pressing down on a grill cheese sandwich.',\n",

(The cast iron hold its heat long enough to continue to cook for 5-10mins).The only issue I have with these pans is when adding minced garlic to a dish being fried.

I'm not overly concerned about this--reseasoning a skillet requires no more than a coating of Crisco in an oven at 350 for an hour. But I don't want to be doing it overly much. In the end, I've found that scrubbing out the pan with plain hot water and a synthetic pad or brush will do the trick.Did I mention that this skillet is HEAVY? I'm 190 and in relatively good shape, and the skillet can still be a bear to handle. Using two hands (there's a handle on both ends) is safest. Try one hand only if you're trying to show off.

I do agree with most of the reviews on the cast iron products that the seasoning on these pre seasoned pieces could be better.  HOWEVER, let it be known seasoning is so simple.  Also just using the pan frequently makes it improve with age.  I have been familiar with cast iron pans since I was a child.  They are heavy  pieces but so worth the lift. :) Cleaning the residual food off, as you never use soap, is so simple.  Use a plastic card, for instance an old credit card, to scrape the pan.  However I do not necessarily say to use a credit card as I do not believe in letting them lay around.  I just wanted to get the idea of what type of card across to you.

Don't let the reputation of cast iron scare you off - it's easy to cook with once you get the hang of it. And it's easy to clean too.

I did not bother to season it again. It is not completely nonstick for certain food. for example, I can't use it to pan fry Tofu (without breading), Tofu is very soft and porous, this pan is porous too. These 2 just get stick with each other.3 It works really well to pan fry anything that is not porous. For example, pancake, dumpling,...... When I use it to make golden pan fry dumplings, I just put in dumplings at very low temperature, it may look like it is sticky at the beginning, just be patient and the dumpling will come off easily when it is ready (golden at the bottom)4. I have to use lots of cooking oil, some of which I guess fills the porous bottom. Maybe if you use it more often than I do, you could end up with a more smooth natural seasoning.\",\n",

You can even use it in the oven as a roaster, on 200C for a couple of hours which of course for tefal would be unthinkable. I\\'ve oven-cooked meat on it, and found it great for roasting potatoes. The reason it\\'s so good is the heat-retaining properties of the tough natural iron. Once heated, it takes ages to cool down again and this is great for cooking almost anything. If you\\'re using oil it remains hot much longer so the food tastes better.As a fry-pan it\\'s not as non-stick as Teflon but I found if you season it, it\\'s then almost as good. You season it by coating the inside with oil, then baking it in the oven for an hour which binds the oil molecules to the iron so they won\\'t wash out - just like a traditional wok. In any case if you use a metal spatula/fish slice, then the food moves no problem. The pan seems to get better non-stick properties the more it\\'s used.Caution: these iron pans are heavy compared to similar-sized teflon-coated aluminium pans, so the larger ones are more difficult to lift and use if you\\'re light of frame.

It doesn\\'t form a very stable base-layer, and frankly, it is quite sticky which defeats the purpose of having a seasoning layer.  Get rid of it using steel wool (in this case just the inside cooking surface, don\\'t bother scrubbing the outside) or the self-clean cycle of your oven.I have to clarify something for those of you who are new to cast iron:  this will NOT match the performance of true \"non stick\" cookware.  But it will cook nicer (than the cheap stuff anyway), and will last longer than 100 of those non-stick pieces put together (literally, not exaggerating, cast iron cookware can last for well over 100 years if not abused too badly).  And it looks great!Cast iron holds heat.  It doesn\\'t respond quickly to temperature changes, so don\\'t get the pan too hot and try to save the food by lowering the heat. It won\\'t work.ALWAYS PREHEAT your cast iron before putting food in. And your food should be near room temperature too, don\\'t dump cold or frozen food in, it will stick more.  Properly preheating your pan and warming up your food will reduce stickiness by a whole lot.  I never use more than 1 tsp oil or other fat in my pans when cooking, and that is already a lot, I often use less.How to season it:I\\'m going to depart from the norm and advise against oven-seasoning.  Why?  Because the times I\\'ve done it it has failed on me eventually (seasoning flaked off), it takes ages, and it wastes a lot of energy.What I recommend you do instead, is similar to what the Chinese and the French recommend you do in cast iron/carbon steel cookware (and they really know what they\\'re doing when it comes to food and cookware).  You heat the unseasoned skillet up very hot on the range (600F ish, don\\'t go TOO overboard with the heat), dump a small piece, about 3/4tsp, of lard into it (or a slab of pork fat from the Asian market), swirl the pan around to coat the surface, it will be VERY smoky, so open all windows and turn on extractor fans and any other fans you might have.  Then wipe the lard out with a tissue or towel, let it smoke for half a minute, wipe again with the oily tissue to coat the pan again, all the time maintaining the high heat.  Repeat this until the tissue/towel is dry, then dump another small piece of lard in and repeat.  Use about 3-4 pieces of lard, then finally wipe the pan dry with a clean tissue, let it heat for another minute or so, then turn off the heat and let it cool.I did this method then tried frying an egg with a little bit of butter, zero stick.  Keep in mind this was a completely newly seasoned pan, with the \"pebble\" finish that so many complain about.This method of seasoning also produces a nicer looking layer of seasoning than the oven method in my experience.',\n",

       " 'UPDATE: I\\'ve had this pan for 7 years now, and for the first several years, only used it for steaks. I would heat it up (outside on my portable burner) until glowing white/gray (which I thought would burn the seasoning off!), and then throw my steak in--it would smoke like mad and the meat would turn BLACK (love blackened steaks!) But this did wonderful things for the seasoning--the interior became glossy smooth and good Lord, nowadys I used this skillet for everything from scrambled eggs to veggies--nothing STICKS in the least and the flavor is incredible! This is what our grandmothers raved about! Finally, I have it! Everyday hard use and abuse is what REAL seasoning is about!___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I had to buy this online, because good luck trying to find this size in any retail store...! The tiny 8\" (with a 6\" cooking surface) is everywhere, as is the 10.5\" (which I have and love), but this size is perfect for a single steak or small meals for one person. I like blackened steaks, getting the pan beyond searing hot, and so this is a great little dedicated steak pan that I can get so hot it almost carbonizes the seasoning off, and I don\\'t have to worry about using it for anything else. However that hasn\\'t happened yet, despite getting the pan up to 850F  over a high BTU gas burner, and having some incredible steaks (with lots of black smoke!) Kudos to Lodge for a very well done pre-seasoning process.This pan did come with some noticable and unsightly cast iron crap (over-spill) from the casting process, attached to the top lip in one area. Personally the blemish is bad enough, I would have rejected it and sent it through the discounted seconds route (ie Marshals/ TJ Max), but I guess that the QA is not that strong at Lodge. However the pan is so easy to use since it is Pre-seasoned, and been so useful for my steak cooking (and I have even scrambled eggs with no sticking), that I forgive Lodge the cosmetic blemishes even though I paid full retail + shipping.The logic Pre-seasoned line is really that good. You will still need to season it slowly, over time, for it to be like our grandmothers age-old seasoning was like on their Griswolds and Wagners, but it\\'s a great start.For frying and searing, cast iron just cannot be beat. It gets HOT and stays HOT. Plus the Lodge products (flawed as they may be) are really superior to many of the cheaper cast iron pans coming in from China (that are pre-seasoned or coated with God-knows-what!

I was browning some chicken and the browning was fantastic - lots of beautiful stuff on the pan which turned into delicious sauce. Cleaning was a bit different from non-stick.

I have found butter to be better than oil for keeping the pan seasoned. I do wash my pan with a sponge with very diluted soap then I set it over the stove and light the fire for 2 min this drys out the pan to prevent rust and then I add a little butter just when I turn off the flame.I use a paper towl and carefully wipe the butter around the hot pan. The heat lets the butter penetrate a bit. The butter does not leave a sticky feeling to the pan like oil does.When I first got my pan I let it soak and accidently forgot about it overnight it rusted badly just in 1 night bud I was able to bring it back to life. I never soak now for more than 5-10 minutes and only if I must.If Something got superstuck add water to pan and let it simmer for 10 minutes.

The coating flaked off, got my hands black, and smelled really rusty.

This is false (it is super dense and can absorb a ton of heat though, which is why it is good for searing and such). Even left on the cooktop for 15 minutes to try to heat evenly, the outside in about a 1 inch thick ring basically did not get hot at all. I tested this at first with my infrared themometer. I thought the readings were lying to me; so, I made some crepes in it. The results were unambiguous. The center was hot and the edge was cold, i.e. the crepe was brown in the center and raw on the outside.Now, I've used this for deep dish pizza. It works great for that. And I think it is cheaper than most pizza pans, so that's not bad (though a pizza pan will likely have a straight side, and this is sloped slightly).If you have a super large cooking surface. For example a grill or an induction burner that covers the full stove surface, this would probably work well on that. Otherwise, it just isn't going to be useful for you.

Just some coarse kosher salt and cold or hot water removes any oils or sticky sauces.The box that contained the Lodge skillet felt light. The factory packed inner box had a label that said 12.\" However, when I opened it my concern was realized. There was a 10\" pan inside. The replacement came quickly and I am supposed to get a credit for my shipping costs.I augmented the alleged \"pre-seasoned\" lodge skillet in the manner I was shown by a chef who was trained by the renowned French chef Escoffier.  The technique is simple. Moderate heat and Crisco solid shortening applied with bunched wax paper. The wax may even abet  the Crisco but the reason it is used is that no cellulose fibers will be incorporated into the shortening patina. Using a paper napkin or towel or cotton cloth will place fibers in the patina and they will create a place for food to adhere to.A teaspoon of Canola (Rapeseed) oil was put in the hot pan and then an egg followed. The egg stuck better than Crazy Glue and this did not surprise me, as I was suspicious of the pan when I saw it had a surface that looked like it had actually been cast in sand (which is still a way to cast iron.)My old, above mentioned, treasures all have surfaces as smooth as a baby\\'s bottom. They are a joy to work with. This pan is a joke. After the abyssmal performance I felt I had nothing to loose by messing with the surface so I tried to smooth out the pebbled (sand cast) surface but gave it up as I lack the proper materials to do so.Nonetheless, I think I may have abraded the so-called pre-seasoned surface enough to lay down my own patina that may smooth out with constant use. Otherwise, I will just use the skillet for frying things other than eggs or pancakes, etc. I saw a similar pan in large chain retailer for less money.A few days after posting my 1 star review I scrubbed the surface and seasoned the pan in a manner similar to that used by an earlier poster. I added Crisco and put in a hot oven. My wife got hot under her collar when the house was full of oily fumes.So I did not cure it for the full 40 minutes.I put the pan in my outdoors gas barbeque grill upside down and closed the cover. A hard patina formed. After a few times of gently warming on the gas stove using a diffuser I gave it a whirl with another egg. This time the pan was not very hot. After flipping the egg over on its yoke I was able to to slide it around like a hockey puck on ice. I had spread almost 1 teaspoon of Canola oil followed by a pat of butter.I am now a happy camper. I recommend this pan even though the cooking surface is not evenly flat and mine had a crease in it as well.I purchased my first Teflon pan in 1970 and it performed awesomely for almost 10 years. This was inexpensive and you could fry an egg without any oil. I gave it up after a good deal of the coating had peeled away. I have never seen a coated pan that performed as well as the first one I purchased. I am sure that companies stopped using that specific very smooth coating by 1980. I just tossed a coated Calphalon skillet that started to stick after 3 years of careful use. My wife would not let me use anything but a special plastic spatula or wooden spoon so it was not abused.Ken BatesBoston',\n",

Unfortunately, I only read the good reviews before purchasing and now after reading the one star reviews I find myself experiencing the same nightmare that so many others have experienced. Shame on Lodge, there is no excuse for this substandard product. I have used Iron skillets for decades and do not speak from ignorance.\",\n",
       " \"It was ok at first, though it was a little bit small.It started to rust on the inside some time ago, which I don't like at all.  It's about 2 years old, but it's been rusting a little at a time for a while.I plan to buy a stainless steel skillet to replace it the next chance I get.\",\n",
       " 'I bought this hoping to get it well seasoned so that I could use it without non stick spray or oil.  Even after using it repeatedly, it never got seasoned enough, and it also started to develop rust spots.  Maybe I was doing something wrong with the care, but I was disappointed, and I ended up giving it away.',\n",
       " \"I love the idea of cast iron skillets, especially when I see them used in cookbooks, but maybe it's because I'm not Southern, but I can't seem to maintain a cast iron skillet, pre-seasoned or not. You have to keep it oiled often and even the tiniest drop of water will cause rust. Once something rusts, I get way too nervous to even consider using it. If you are up for the challenge of maintaining, I think it looks very nice and heats well, especially on a bbq or gas flame.\",\n",
       " \"After one time use, although i coated with oil..it burned on the surface of the pan and I can't get off  the food that sticks to the pan. I poured the water for a couple of hours to clean.. and it rusted and I smelled iron. I can't still clean off the surface.. it doesn't come off ever. My money is gone ~!\",\n",
       " 'I got this because I need more iron, and I eat a lot of eggs. I found the surface too rough to cook eggs and get them out of the pan. You would  have to float them on butter or oil to get them out of this pan. Back to my non stick pan...I would take it camping, if I ever went camping.']"

       "'Just say no to chemical treatments on non stick pans, get yourself and your friends a few sizes of cast iron and have pans that you can pass down to your children, without all those unknown chemicals that are such a part of pans for the last few decades. This is an absolutely amazing skillet!!  I use it ALL the time!!  I re-season it a bit as well to keep it going strong! So far I am loving this skillet! It\\'s priced well and you can tell it is good quality.  I\\'ve used it to make a skillet cookie, asparagus, and saute shrimp (not all at the same time!).  It performed very well - and I\\'m looking forward to getting much more use out of it. The negative reviews?  Ignore them. I read a 3-star review complaining that the pan rusts if water is left in it!  And another review complaining that the handle gets hot!!If you are familiar with cast-iron, and are willing to give it the minimal care it requires, you\\'ll love this.  It\\'s exactly what you expect, and gets better with every use. I enjoy using it, don\\'t mind caring for it, and appreciate the finished product only cast iron cooking delivers. A nice piece of cast Iron.  Lodge simply does not take the time anymore to proplery finish their pans.  A true cast iron pan is super smooth.  With proper seasoning (not the garbage spray lodge puts on) a nice piece of cast iron will be virtuly non-stick.  Lodge simply does not spend the time to finish their pans like they used to and the pans suffer now. I got this for the hype of searing steaks and etc on cast iron. Having no experience with it at all I just did some google searches to figure out how to &#34;season&#34; it etc. For me, I opened it up and rubbed a small layer of oil on it and preheated it in the oven to 500 fahrenheit as per the recipe I followed for a steak. I added the layer of oil because I wasn\\'t sure if the &#34;pre seasoned&#34; would ruin my dinner or not. Anyway, took it out of the oven and onto the stove, dropped the steak and ended up with an awesome dinner and no mess or smoke. Next day, cooked eggs and ham on it, no stick and no mess. Excellent excellent excellent! First off, I\\'m an absolute idiot in the kitchen.  Aside from toast and the occasional omelet, the only things I can make with any success are on the grill.  Alas, I live in an apartment and it isn\\'t feasible for me to have an outdoor grill.  Enter the Lodge 12 inch cast iron skillet.  I bought this, somewhat reluctantly, as what I at the time considered a poor replacement for a \"real\" grill.Now, obviously this isn\\'t exactly the same as grilling, but for some things - particularly lean steaks and pork chops, it does an excellent job.  In fact, after cooking my first fillet Mignon in this skillet I realized it\\'s actually better suited to this cut of meat than an outdoor grill - it leaves a perfectly seared, caramelized exterior and a nice red interior (just like I like it).  Like I said, it does a similarly excellent job for pork chops and other relatively lean cuts of beef.  It also can also be used to fry up a pretty mean burger - but be warned, burgers, and other fattier cuts of meat, create a LOT of smoke when cooked indoors on this baby, even with a window cracked and the exhaust fan on (I cooked a ribeye a while back that left my apartment smelling like a bbq pit for like 3 days, it was worth it though).Cleaning it is easy.  I just get it hot (either by cleaning soon after using it or heating it up in the oven before cleaning) and scrub with some kosher salt and a paper towel, rinsing it out afterwards (and immediately wiping it off, I don\\'t leave it to dry as it could rust).In short - this thing is great, and well worth the price.  It\\'s truly nonstick, and it gives a great sear.  For certain cuts of meat, like chops and burgers, it\\'s a good substitute for a real grill.  For others, like a fillet Mignon, it\\'s better than most grills due to the perfectly caramelized exterior.  It\\'s also extremely durable and should last forever if you take care of it. Works great on my induction stove, heats up fast and the food tastes wonderful. I got the 10 in. and it was a perfect size for me. I use this skillet all the time cooking steaks and when i fry anything.  Works great! very easy to clean. As some on else said, this is made for steaks, but really for any meat. That being said, it\\'s just a great pan. You really can\\'t go wrong with Lodge Logic; it is seen as the top cast iron for a reason. It\\'s a good product and I would recommend any Lodge Logic piece to anyone. I would also recommend the griddle...it\\'s great.If you are going between the 10 and 12 inch pan...get the 12 there\\'s more room for a full steak. I like all my cast iron. This one though the tissue I wiped it with was black and wouldn\\'t stop. It peeled a bit on the handle. I didn\\'t get it. Out of all of my iron ware this one was so disgusting I washed it with soap.  It looked as if all the preseason had come off so I just did my own srasoning. I\\'m in the process of building it up. It\\'s good now. My fried chicken got burnt a tiny bit, it was still edible. But for a skillet that has never been used before that is better than great. Next time I cook I should get the hang of things and prevent that from happening. My mother and mother-in-law both cook with skillets that have been well seasoned, and I\\'m very happy to achieve the same with mine. I love using my Cast Iron skillets just love them. I own the 8\" and the 12\" and use them both quite often. The 8\" I use for baking my corn breads and the 12\" I use for everything else. I\\'m still breaking them in so some things tend to stick at times. But as long as you own the right tools clean up is a breeze. I do not regret my purchase one bit! Like Alton Brown says, this is the pan to have.  When properly cared for (meaning by seasoning it once in awhile and not abrasively scrubbing and washing this pan with soap water) this pan will be the best non-stick pan you can find!As a professional cook, when I cook at home I use this pan regularly.  From deep frying (nice heavy pan holds heat well), pan searing then putting the whole pan into the oven to roast and finish, to even baking!Do not use this for braising or say... making pasta, liquids don\\'t do too well for this pan.  I highly recommend this pan.  Lodge has been making cast-iron for a long time and they make great products. This is my first experience cooking with cast iron. So far it is going well. Even though the instructions said to expect eggs to stick the first few uses, I did not have a problem. I did let the pan heat up, sprayed it with PAM, fried my eggs and they slid off like from Teflon. I was most impressed. I will be buying more cast iron pans in the future. If you\\'re looking for a cast iron skillet this is the one you should buy. The price is fantastic and the skillet is a great size.This is a necessity for any home chef. This thing holds flavor from the meals that you cook on it, so when you have future meals, you get these bursts of flavor from every previous cooking experience. It really is magical and there is no other way to cook. You don\\'t have to worry about scratching the skillet because it\\'s pure iron. You can fit a ton of food in it. The explosive flavor that this thing produces due all the yummy fats and sauces that have seeped into it are the best part, though.There are a few downsides of course: 1) It\\'s heavy as hell, 2) the handle gets too hot to hold without a mitten, 3) it takes a little bit longer to heat up than standard skillets that are thinner, 4) it\\'s kind of easy to burn your fingers on the edges of the skillet when you go to stir the food, and 5) I hear that you can ruin the skillet if you use soap to clean it. We got this as a gift from our wedding registry.It\\'s solid, heavy, and it\\'s already taken a great deal of cooking, including stovetop to oven.We were so pleased with the way it cooked, we bought another as a gift to a friend.So far, no cracks, no breaks, no scratches, no defects. Looking forward to seasoning this further!Edit: 3/29/14Still kicking! I never cooked with cast iron so I can\\'t explain why, but I prefer using this lodge logic to my other nice cookware.My wife has made sure that I keep and clean it correctly when I use it, so it\\'s in perfect shape and cooks beautifully. I had an ancient 8 inch cast iron skillet that has been in my family forever and it\\'s getting very pitted and food is sticking more and more.  So I was happy to find this, seasoned it and used it a few times, now it\\'s perfect. It actually rusted a bit when we cleaned it after first use; so we did indeed still have to season it ourselves, but after that it\\'s been a trooper. (If you\\'re worried about the rusting, don\\'t be; that\\'s a side effect of cleaning a not-well-seasoned pan too aggressively and it\\'s easily fixed. It won\\'t wreck it.) This thing cooks everything we\\'ve thrown in it perfectly. Great for bacon, great for hash browns. Haven\\'t tried steaks yet, I\\'m sure we will soon. Great, solid skillet. First time I\\'ve bought a skillet and I\\'m really happy with it. I\\'ve made everything from German pancakes to steak in it and it works really well. Just like my parent\\'s had when I was a kid. Season it after each washing and it will serve you well. The cast iron holds the heat and heats evenly. Just great to cook with each time. For years and years, I avoided buying a cast iron skillet.  I\\'d never cooked with one and found the idea of using something not coated in teflon pretty intimidating.Then, I got this Lodge cast iron skillet.  Before using it, I read several articles online about properly seasoning, cooking with, and cleaning cast iron and followed these directions to the letter.  Even though the skillet is pre-season, I seasoned it myself using bacon grease.  I rubbed on some bacon grease, popped the skillet into the oven, heated it for a while, took it out, let it cool, then repeated.  The first couple of times I used the skillet, it produced a lot of smoke.  As the skillet becomes more seasoned over time, it smokes less.To clean my cast iron skillet, I pour avocado oil into it while it\\'s still warm and dump in some coarse sea salt.  I use a clean, lint-free cloth to scrub the oil and salt into the skillet, removing any cooked on food.  Then, I give it a good rinse in hot water and place the skillet into a hot oven until it is dry (quickly drying with heat avoids a build up of rust).  Once the skillet is dry, I pour in just a bit of oil and spread it around before storing the pan until the next use.With good care and a bit of effort, cast iron is a kitchen essential.  I love using it to sear meats, then finishing in the oven.  It\\'s great for bacon, corn bread, home made tortillas, and so many other things.  I wish I\\'d gotten a good cast iron skillet years ago, but I do enjoy making up for lost time!  This skillet is very heavy; the extra handle is there because you really do need to use it.  Unless you have arms of steel.  Which I don\\'t.  Regardless, this is a great cast iron piece to start with and you can\\'t beat the price! my mother had one like this but smaller. I cook large portions for my family and grandkids sometimes so it works out quite well. almost non stick when seasoned and this one came already seasoned. also bought one for  my daughter who has a houseful all the time. They are heavy to handle but if you are buying a cast iron skillet, you know that anyway. durable, practically indestructible, something you can hand down to the next generation. a classic. While a cracked or fractured skillet is NEVER good . . .I bought this skillet from Kroger grocery store as I was away from home and did not have my own cookware.  What did I find to be true?  Yes, absolutely, there is a texture to this skillet.  Yes, there are some places where the texture is sticking up a little higher (one or two places the size of a sharpened pencil), but it has not caused me any issues and they are wearing down.  Lodge has always made a high quality skillet.  If you carefully examine most cast iron cookware, you will see some imperfections.The first three times I used my skillet, I re-seasoned it at 450 degrees.  The pre-seasoning done by Lodge is good for a foundation, but you should expect to improve upon it.  I do not use soap (although the Lodge website says that a small amount won\\'t hurt it) because my grandmother would roll over in her grave, if I did it.  I scrub the skillet with a nylon brush until it is as clean as I can get it.  I then use a Lodge scraper (bought from Amazon: Lodge SCRAPERPK Durable Polycarbonate Pan Scrapers, Red and Black, 2-Pack) and scrape off any remaining food.  I dry the skillet immediately and while it is still warm, spread extra virgin light olive oil on the pan (inside and out).  I use my hands and not a paper towel to avoid leaving lint on the pan.  I also use my hands because it is easier to control how thin the oil is spread.  It should be coated, but not overly shiny and definitely not dripping.  If it is too shiny, I use a junk bath cloth to remove oil.  After sliding a sheet of aluminum foil on the oven shelf on the bottom, I slip my skillet into the pre-heated over on the middle shelf and set the timer for an hour.  After an hour, I cut off the heat and let the oven (and the skillet) return to room temperature (don\\'t open the oven door, as the slower the heat drop, the better).  When the oven is back at room temperature, I take out the skillet and store it in my cabinet.  After the third seasoning routine, I did not have to do it again at 450 degrees.How do I take care of my cookware on a daily basis?  I cook on it daily and have cooked everything from eggs to hamburgers, pancakes, etc. I only cook on medium or just a bit over medium, since anything beyond that might burn the food.  I clean my skillet with a nylon brush, drying it immediately.  I spread a thin layer of olive oil on the inside of the skillet and then wipe it down with the bath cloth (all over).  Every third or fourth time I use it, I re-season it at a lower temperature (say 350 degrees).  My grandmother got to a point when she only seasoned her pans two or three times per year.Also, I would prefer to use flax seed oil in the seasoning process, but, if you do your research, there are all sorts of debates on what type oil to use.  I use extra light olive oil when I have it and flax seed oil when I can get my hands on it. As a lover of cast iron this was a great piece. I purchased it so as to use it in my toaster oven and it works great for that purpose. The larger skillets don\\'t work as well. Also this smaller skillet lets me make smaller portions, another reason I purchased it. Thanks for a great product. This is the first cast iron pan I\\'ve ever used and it\\'s wonderful.  We all know what a pain it can be to clean up eggs, but even after burning them, this pan still cleaned up easily.  After a second try at a lower heat level, I could actually watch the eggs lift from the pan when they were ready to be flipped.  Lodge Logic also makes a pan called the one egg wonder... well, I think this is the 2-3 egg wonder.  However, it\\'s certainly not limited to eggs.  One piece of bread fits perfectly so grilled cheeses, toasted sandwiches and the like are great here too, among other things.It fit the small burner on my electric stove perfectly.  It covers all of the coils so no uncovered heat and all the dangers that that implies.If you\\'re new to cast iron, as I am, make sure to use something when touching the handle.  I\\'m used to being able to grabbing the handle of anything that\\'s on the stove and with this one that\\'s not the case, which I fortunately figured out before it got too hot. I purchased three of these pans a couple of years ago.  I use them all the time to heat up left overs, make pies, bake bread, cook eggs, fry bacon, and anything else that fits into it.  These were my first cast iron pans.  I burned the first thing I tried to cook by using too high of a heat and not seasoning it first.  I do recommend that you season it before using it and after each time it is used.  After washing, I put it on a medium heat, coat it lightly with oil using a paper towel, let it heat for a few minutes, then wipe it clean and cool it down before storing it again.  This works great! These pans are now nonstick and clean up very easily. When I have used the procedure that Lodge recommends, my cast iron has become gummy. 7 years later, I\\'m still using this same skillet; it has been reseasoned once or twice (to get progressively better seasoning), and is still going strong.A tip: the best seasoning process I\\'ve found to give a hard, slick surface is 5+ very thin coats of flax seed oil, wiping it off after apply the oil and before baking.  This gives it a hard, deep black layer. Always wanted a cast iron skillet. Well, we\\'ve been replacing all of our teflon and figured to give a cast iron skillet a try...LOVE it! Cooks well. Cleans pretty easily. And hopefully within a few weeks/months we will have a well-seasoned skillet! Best cast iron ever and with Amazon\\'s price...even better! I used Emiril cast Iron before and was garbage. It never seasoned, was hard to clean and had hot spots all throughout that made cooking a chore. This pan has virtually no hot spots, seasons well, as a result cleans like a dream. I will have this for life. Better than expected.  Great size.  Great price.  Pre-seasoned, though we\\'ve seasoned it ourselves.  It\\'s not the easiest to clean, since you can\\'t just throw it in the dish washer, but that\\'s with any cast iron skillet. Bought this and the 8 inch skillet because I want to get away from teflon. Some things don\\'t seem to cook as well in cast-iron but for the most part they\\'re both great. I still haven\\'t quite gotten the hang of seasoning. This pan comes pre-seasoned, but it needs additional seasoning to become more non-stick. It\\'s a little heavier than I expected but not so much that I can\\'t use it.  Cleaning was so much easier than expected, as well (I\\'m keeping it seasoned).  Overall, I\\'m enjoying cooking with cast iron and this skillet seems perfect.  Shipped and arrived quickly, too! Love: after seasoned, I could cook anything in it without sticking! Easy to take care of. Just wash with hot water, without soap. Dry with a towel and spray some cooking spray on it before putting it away.Hate: So HEAVY! I can\\'t lift it with one hand with that tiny handle, even worse when there is food in there! I know it\\'s cast iron, I know, I know.....It makes stove top to oven cooking method quite challenging. This is a product I have longed to buy myself for years!  But it\\'s also been one of those things that I always looked at but never got around to buying it.  I decided to take advantage of a gift card I received from someone at my job and FINALLY purchase this skillet.  It was the absolutely best decision I could have made.  The minute I received it, I cleaned it and started using it.  Used it twice that day.  First I fried some pork chops on it and later that day we made a pineapple cake.  This skillet did just fine with both things.  The cake came out spongy soft and lifted right off the skillet.  I am sure we will make good use out of this purchase for a long, long time. Was looking at bacon presses for more money and saw a review saying they bought a press and ended up using a small cast iron pan instead. I found this and it works great, for more than just bacon, worked great on pork chop and chicken breast last weekend. Lodge is quality. Went to visit my daughter and noticed she only cooks in cast iron so I decided to give it a try. She highly recommended this brand so I took a leap and have no regrets. I love it. I cook every meal I can in it. I soak my pan in warm to hot water and use a soft to medium bristle brush to get food off. I never leave it wet- I dry it off by putting on gas stove and add some oil so its ready for my next use. My daughter advised that the more I use the less it will stick - she was right. She uses these pans on an electric stove while I use gas- same results. I would advise to never set burner on high. Before I start cooking, I let it get warm on low (so heat distributes evenly) till I see a little bit of smoke starting to rise- seems to help in avoiding the food from sticking. Broke this bad boy out for the first time when we had family unexpedly in the need to spend the night. I made breakfast the next morning in my 10 1/4\" skillet (the \"small\" one). Inside I put the following: 1/2 lb cut up bacon, 1/2 lb cut up hot links, 1/4 lb cut up turkey deli meat, 1/4 cut up onion, and 16 large eggs. Everything fit with no problem. I had always used \"non-stick\" pans and have gotten tired of the non-stick going away after a few uses. This came pre-seasoned like the description says, but I also added some olive oil to the pan. I did get a little sticking of the eggs on the grooves of the pan, but I chalk that up to me not getting the utinsil in there to move it around. There was also a tiny bit of sticking towards the top of the skillet, but not much. The food cooked quickly and VERY evenly. As the 952nd person to review this, I would say that this is a quality product worth purchasing.Recipe:1/2 lb bacon cut up1/2 lb hot links cut up1/4 lb turkey or ham deli meat cut up1/4 onion cut up16 large eggsSecret ingredient: Tapatio hot sauceKraft Mexican style cheeseHeat skillet on just above med heat. When heated, put bacon in the pan. Let cook for a few min then add the onion and hot links. After about 2 min of cooking, add a few splashes on Tapatio hot sauce. The more you add, the more spicy it will be. Next, add the turkey and mix it all together. While all those ingredients are sharing their flavor with each other, crack all the eggs and beat them in a bowl. DO NOT ADD MILK TO EGGS. When all the meat is fully cooked to your preference (everyone likes their bacon at a different crunch level), add the eggs to the skillet. Continue to cook and fold the eggs in on itself until eggs are fully cooked. Serve right away and while still hot, mix a small handful of cheese into your eggs. Add salt, pepper, or more Tapatio hot sauce if you would like, and enjoy! I have a small gas grill, and this little frying pan has become my favorite and most useful grilling accessory. It fits on the grill (even with the grill\\'s cover closed) and still leaves room for a steak or a couple of burgers. But it\\'s big enough to hold a medium potato. Smaller veggies, like sliced onions or mushrooms, can be put on at about the same time as the meat. Skillet Potatoes should go on the grill 15 or 20 minutes before the meat. The pan is heavy enough to let you stir food without pushing the pan around too much. Make sure the skillet is seasoned inside and out, so if the meat bumps into the skillet it won\\'t stick. They make all kinds of gadgets to grill veggies and other small stuff on the grill, but a plain old cast iron pan does just fine. Plus you can use it for bacon and eggs as well. I have to guess that cast iron is one of those things that, either you grow up with it and you are used to it, or no one in your family has ever owned one and you just don\\'t get why anyone would want one of these pans.  I will openly admit that I was firmly entrenched in the second category until the age of 42....  I have always been of the mindset, I hate being in the kitchen, and everything that goes along with it, so why put any energy into looking into anything new.  Well, for all of my adult life, I had lived with cheap non-stick pans and when my last set went, my husband went and got me a Rachel Ray set for much more than I had ever spent.  Well, that was about 4 years ago, and the inside of every pot is peeling and flaking.  I decided that I wasn\\'t going to keep eating my pots, so wanted something without a non-stick coating, and I\\'m too bad a cook to go for a plain metal pot, because I had visions of all of the scrubbing I would have to do to get off burnt food.  I looked at the cast iron, and decided that the price wasn\\'t bad, and if I hated cooking on it, it is heavy enough to make a good weapon if anyone breaks into my house.  Well, I have to say, I used this to cook bacon (which I am terrible at cooking), and I made the most perfect batch of bacon of my life.  I have also used it to make a mean chicken marsala, eggs, browned some ground beef, etc.  This is now my go to pan, and I will be ordering more in the very near future.  For the record, they state that you should use some oil the first few times you cook so it doesn\\'t stick, and I did find that to be helpful, but even when my eggs stuck a little, it was easy enough to scrape right off. I must say this cast iron skillet is quickly becoming my favorite to cook in after only one week. I have cooked two meals in it and have thoroughly enjoyed the outcome. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys cooking. Received this skillet and discovered it had scratches in the bottom of it which marred the pre-seasoning.  It also had a large scrape on the side inside which was rusted so there was no preseasoning on it.  The handle is so short that it is always overheating.I own 2 other Farberware larger pre-seasoned cast iron skillets and they arrived in perfect condition.  They also have longer handles which are more ergonomically designed so they are easier to use and never overheat.I love cast iron since it is so durable but it would have been too expensive to ship the Lodge skillet back for a replacement so I kept it the way it was.  I will have to do the seasoning myself on it.I personally think that Farberware makes a better, more user friendly product and would recommend their cast iron products over Lodge. Once you cooked on cast iron, you will never want to use anything else.  This is your basic indestructible frying pan.  The food tastes better and don\\'t forget the health benefits.  Using cast iron adds iron to your food and therefore your body.  I am a cast iron snob.  I won\\'t use anything else.  This stuff is the best.  Every kitchen needs this frying pan. Again the item is terrific, no more frying potatoes in the skillet first to season it, it works great but very, very small. Perfect for 2 eggs or one burger, not much else. Also over priced, same item at Target or WM for much less. Be careful! One of my heavy-duty non-stick aluminum pans started flaking off, and I needed replacement. Being lazy, I decided to try something bigger than the regular 12 inches across, so I could cook enough to store it in the fridge and be free from cooking for couple of days. I was a little apprehensive, as I never used cast iron before. Believe me or not, the thing is NON STICK to about the same degree as the non-stick pans. Being much heavier, it does not have cold/hot spots. Cooks on lower heat, too. Surprisingly easy to clean. Now that I know, I will look for something cast iron to do my roasts...  preferably another pre-seasoned Lodge Logic. Oh, last but certainly not least: it is still quality made in the good old USofA. The Amazon picture of this item is that of a different pan.  To visualize this item, think of the handle as having the dimensions of a popsicle stick, with the rest being comparable in size to a manhole cover.  Yes, it is that big.  The price I got from Amazon, $29.99 plus free shipping, is by the pound about 4 times higher than the world market price for bulk scrap iron, but on the other hand this merchandise is delivered to one\\'s doorstep in the shape of a useful finished cooking utensil, with an excellent preseasoned treatment.  If you have a high-output gas burner on your stovetop, you can witness the contest of irresistable force against immovable object.  Throw two pounds of mussels into it, right out of the box, or a big steak, or a pan pizza.  You might need to order a little red wagon to cart it around the house, but if you\\'ve got the wagon already, this is a fabulous deal.  This massive, imperturbable object has led me to wonder, who will be using it 300 years from now?  Well, if they still have fires in their kitchens then, they\\'ll be thinking the same thing too. Oh but my cornbread sure taste good when baked in my iron skillet. Lodge is the name when it comes to iron cookware. Many kitchens in the US have Lodge products in them. Especially in the south. More cornbread please. FANTASTIC pan, that I got as a steal through Amazon Prime! It\\'s HUGE and I can cook for the entire family in this thing! Woo Hoo! My only &#34;problem&#34; is now finding a lid that will fit it--and one that doesn\\'t cost me more than what I paid for the pan itself! I already own a cast iron skillet with ridges and use it often for \"grilling\" steaks and fish when I want grill marks.  However, I also wanted a flat surface skillet to roast duck.  This skillet seemed like the best option because it has a large cooking surface, it came preseasoned, and because I think that Lodge Logic is a good brand (I own their hibachi grill which works very well).When I use the skillet nothing sticks to it and cleaning is easy.  The only thing that should be improved, in my opinion, is the length of the handle.  I think it would be more comfortable to grab if the handle was longer.  I use a silicone pan handle sleeve and the handle seems short and a little tricky to grab inside the sleeve.Overall, I am glad I purchased this pan. I read the reviews on Amazon for my smoker. They told me to get a 8 inch Skillet. I bought this with it. It works great. I couldn\\'t be more pleased. Love it!  The size is good for bulk cooking such as 4 servings worth of food.  I sometimes take it from the stovetop directly into the oven too and have had no problems.  It is a bit heavy but I\\'m a petite female.  Nothing that two hands can\\'t handle though.Below is contains some of the same info as the 6\" skillet review and basically sings accolades about cast iron and Lodge Logic in general.I love cooking with cast iron because it heats evenly.  After doing extensive research on the best cookware that doesn\\'t leech harmful chemicals, I choose to cook with cast iron.  Lodge Logic hasn\\'t failed me; I own the 6 inch version of this skillet and a dutch oven.  Very durable.  Great value and great quality.  I almost feel like I\\'m stealing.  I don\\'t even want to try other cast iron products.Cleaning is a breeze as it is virtually non-stick (without those synthetic chemicals).  I can\\'t speak for its oil-free non-stick quality because I love to use olive oil and butter in my cooking (I\\'m a healthy, organic eater and my research says those items are good for you, especially if you use raw butter). This a great size pan for me and my family. All the cast iron I own is Lodge Logic and it holds up forever. I called Lodge and verified that the combo package with the glass lid contains L10SK3 skillet.  You can find that hereLodge 12 inch Skillet with Glass LidI received mine with no problems related to shipping. Got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he was so excited.  He had a 9&#34; already so when I got him this 12&#34; we was awed at how much more food he could fit in the pan now. He loves it! When I was growing up, my mother had a ten inch cast iron skillet in which she cooked almost everything. One of my best memories is when I was standing by her side, watching her fix red-eye gravy, fried chicken, eggs, vegetables, sauces of an amazing variety. If it could be cooked, it could be cooked in her cast iron skillet.That skillet now resides in my kitchen, and it is still used for almost everything, even though my style of cooking has changed a bit from what I learned from my mother. Between a cast iron dutch oven (also from my mother\\'s kitchen) and this skillet, for every day cooking, I have almost all I need (my other \\'necessary\\' is a good coffee maker, but that\\'s another story.) I suppose I should mention here that I am well over my second 20th birthday. Both the the skillet and dutch oven have been in use for at least half a century. I\\'m not sure how long the well-seasoned skillet was in use before it came to my mother. I do know that it was not new when she began using it.It occurred to me one day that I might be passing these wonderful things along to yet another generation. While I would be happy to bequeath my mother\\'s tools, I also wanted something of mine to go with them. I thought another skillet would be just the thing.This skillet is bigger than my mother\\'s. It might not be suitable for everyday cooking the way hers is. But once in a while, a large skillet is called for, and this one is perfect. It\\'s big enough to cook large amounts of food, but not too large to handle. I\\'ve had it for a while now, and it\\'s just starting to acquire that wonderful, smooth black surface that all cast iron gets, if used and cared for correctly. I\\'ve had no problems at all with it.I know there are proponents of cast iron cookware and there are those who don\\'t understand what all the hoopla is about. Cast iron is certainly not for everyone. I have an aunt who will not cook in anything but good stainless steel and who looks down her nose at anything cast iron. So be it, that\\'s her choice and far be it from me to question any good cook\\'s choices. Different schools of cooking have different tastes and that\\'s fine.If you\\'ve ever really used good cast iron cookware, however, you will appreciate this skillet. Throw out all pre-conceived notions of how cooking &#34;should&#34; be done, and you might come to believe that almost everything, from soup to desserts, tastes better when cooked in cast iron. I would recommend a good skillet for any newcomer to start with, though maybe not this large.For those who are newcomers, let me say this: Good seasoning is an absolute requirement for ALL cast iron cookware. Without it you run the risk not only of ruining your food, but of ruining a wonderful cooking tool. If you simply cannot bring yourself to season it with animal fat, use Crisco. Vegetable oil of any kind out of a bottle just won\\'t do the job. Use it liberally and in the beginning, use it often. I would recommend seasoning the pot or pan or skillet at least twice - three times is better - before you use it. Don\\'t use soap on it for at least two years. To loosen stuck particles, heat the pan, dump in hot water, and let it boil for a few minutes. Wipe dry completely, and oil liberally while the pan still retains some heat. If rust spots should ever develop (which should not happen if the pan is cared for correctly), scour the spots with steel wool until completely gone and then re-season the pan as if it was brand new. All cast iron under ten years old should be re-seasoned every few months.Too much to do just to have a skillet or pan to use? Maybe, if you\\'re too busy to cook a lot. Most people, I suppose, simply don\\'t want to bother with the care needed for cast iron to become an actual heirloom. I can understand that, but I think it\\'s a little sad. How many products that are used almost every day can you pass along to your grandchildren, especially ones that can be such great repositories of wonderful, happy memories? To me, using and caring for this cookware is a form of nurturing my family and even descendants I don\\'t have yet. It represents a family tradition and there aren\\'t all that many anymore that we can hand down over the years. The tools we use to live our everyday lives are the basis of those traditions. Hopefully, this skillet will now be one of them. This is a really fun little pan to use.  It\\'s too small to do much with, but I think it\\'s great for making one egg.  My fiance and I have had fun using it.  It also would be nice as a spoon rest to leave on your stovetop, but really I think it\\'s more of a novelty item than anything. I used it right out of the box to fry an egg and didn\\'t have any problems with the egg sticking to the pan.My only gripe is that they don\\'t make a tiny little lid for this pan!  It would be perfect if I could find a lid to fit it. My yellow banner says I purchased this item February 2011. I just want to say that I treat it well and never use soap on it. I try to keep it oiled. Mainly I sear chicken and then throw the whole shebang into a hot oven. It makes the best baked chicken then fries eggs in the morning that do not stick. Now all I need is a lid but I don\\'t think I need it for what I do. We love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff - we love nothing more than our cast iron and Lodge makes great ones at decent prices. I didn\\'t buy this and the 12\" skillets on Amazon, but elsewhere. I love this thing! The steaks came out so evenly brown and juicy on the inside. Fried fish with less than 1 tsp of oil came out so crispy and even cooked on the outside and delicious and moist on the inside. It\\'s so healthy too!Just make sure you season it a couple times before first use for nonstick to work better.I love them so much that started my cast iron collection and got rid of all my teflon pots and pan.I highly recommend buying this and other cast iron products, especially made by Lodge- Made in the USA! this is my favorite skillet. It is a must have in every kitchen. This one was the perfect size. I use it constantly I bought these to make &#34;big cookies&#34; and put ice cream on top for my husband and I.  We had one at a restaurant and they used a small cast iron skillet.  It works great, but I realized, one is too big for one of us.  So in the future we will share one. The Lodge skillet is the gold standard in modern cast iron skillets. The thing is indestructible - I\\'ve dropped it on a concrete floor, I\\'ve taken it camping, and I\\'ve left it in a shed all winter, and the thing still looks great. I will say that I put a lot of work into seasoning it with bacon grease initially, and the skillet has never seen a drop of soap. This means that it has a pretty decent nonstick finish these days. Despite these traits, it\\'s still not as good as an antique Griswold skillet from the 1940s, because the antique skillet has a much smoother metal finish on the cooking surface, making it much more nonstick. This Lodge skillet is a bit rough on the cooking surface, as if there was no machining after the skillet was cast. Wut up homie, so dis skillet is rel nice.  we use it for paninis n chickn grillin.  Yall should get one. Wow... I cooked two bone-in rib eye steaks with this skillet and it tasted way better than when I ate at a fine dining steak houses.  This skillet cooks the steak evenly throughout every part.  My only complain is that it is too darn heavy but I guess cast iron skillets are all heavy.. This little pan is so cute and it\\'s uses are limited.  I like using this to melt butter on my stove versus the microwave. For me there is nothing better to cook with. I highly recommend this &#34;Pre-Seasoned&#34; skillet. It\\'s ready to use. I use this size to cook chicken and beef for myself, one serving. It\\'s the perfect size for one person! Good quality!! Can\\'t handle with one hand. I tried to use it the first time to make egg. It was way too sticky for the egg and took me quite a while to clean it and re-seasoned it. This is exactly what I was looking for.  Sometimes I just want to melt a little butter or the like and this goes right on the &#34;warm&#34; spot on my stovetop.  The same lifelong quality as larger skillets. One heavy (yeah, yeah, its cast iron -of course its hefty in weight!) -sturdy skillet that we use all the time. Start on the stove top then throw it in the oven to finish. Great for our favorite pork chop recipe. Kinda want to try bread in it like the pictures show! This is now my GO TO pan for almost all cooking. I freaking love it to bits. It\\'s so darn heavy you could use it as a defense weapon in case of a breakin! This cast iron skillet is really nice if you take care of it. If you are not careful it can turn on you.I would recommend taking off the pre-seasoning and re-seasoning the skillet yourself. You will get a much better season.Wash with hot water and a scrubber or with hot oil and salt. Never use soap and never leave water sitting in it for long. Always dry after using. If you are not careful your non-stick seasoning can get removed and you will end up with a ruined meal.I have had a good number of times where I did a poor job cleaning it the time before and then my eggs will stick the next time. It makes me a bit hesitant with really sticky foods, like eggs.Get into a good habit of taking care of your skillet and it will serve you well. I am a recent convert to cast iron and I couldn\\'t be happier with my decision.  This is in no small part to the quality and duarbility of Lodge items such as this 12&#34; skillet.  Seasoning is easy, just follow the many guides online.  After a couple uses, the pan was non-stick enough to make pancakes without butter in the pan.  The even heating and easy clean-up can\\'t be beat. just got this to supplement my nonstick skillet. Used it so far for bacon, chicken under the broiler and eggs. bacon and eggs cleaned up well, but the chicken got kind of cripsed on, so I had to use a scrub pad, which removed some of the season...be careful! big enough for two people at once, more than that you need the bigger version. I am new to the family of Lodge, but I definitely plan on staying around a while.  I was hesitant that the quality of this pan would be poor after checking the price, but I must say I am pleasantly suprised.  I bought this pan mainly to make cornbread in and though it is a little large it sure can make one heck of a good pan of cornbread.  Growing up in the south I learned quick that cornbread that is actually worth eating must be made with a few simple ingredients:  cornmeal, buttermilk, fatback grease, and most importantly, cast iron.  Lodge makes the cookware a breeze to use since these pans are pre-seasoned.  They\\'re easy to take care of and fairly simple to clean up.  I find that just filling it with piping hot water while the pan is still hot removes most of the residue.  Anything else can be wiped out with a towel or a sponge, but NO soap.  Then just spray with a little vegetable spray while it\\'s still warm and you\\'re all done.  You can\\'t ask for easier bakeware.  The people at lodge craft their items in a small town in Tennessee.  I\\'d like to think that southerners make the best cast iron, afterall you can\\'t make good cornbread without it. A well made Skillet that is one of the best on the market.  Never been disappointed with Lodge products.I have others and love them in my Kitchen Sausages are a favorite in our household and I specifically bought this skillet to cook them.  I wanted something more efficient to cook sausages.  This can fit about 3-4 standard size grocery store sausages (Johnsonville, Hillshire, etc.).  It makes a nice crust and keep the sausages juicy on the inside.  My husband actually request I cook the sausages with this pan.As mentioned in the other reviews, this pan isn\\'t seasoned very well.  I seasoned it when I first bought it, and the sausages turned out great.  Then I tried cooking an egg - sticky mess.  For eggs or larger cut of meat, I recommend the de Buyer pan.  Otherwise, this pan works great for smaller portions. This review is for the tiny 3.5 inch iron skillet.  I am rating it 5 stars because it is exactly what I expected, a miniature iron skillet to hang on the wall near my stove.  It is an authentic Lodge iron skillet, just very tiny.  I cannot imagine using it to cook anything, but I did not want it for that.  I seasoned it again in the oven so that it would be blacker, like the larger iron cookware that I use.  Cracker Barrel also has tiny 3.5-inch Lodge iron skillets, but they have cutesy sayings molded into them, and I didn\\'t want that. The one sold on amazon is just as shown, a plain little miniature.To use for cooking, the minimum size that is practical for me is the 6-inch round skillet, and that\\'s a very small skillet.  I use my 8-inch and 10-inch iron skillets most often. I bought a few different sizes all at once I do think this one seems the nicest not only in terms of weight and usability but I also feel the pre-season was the best. Perhaps too soon to tell though. I love cooking with this skillet, it gives everything that a cast iron product should and you can fit almost any size protein in it.  We recently seared and follow-up baked 5 Cornish hens (yes, it is that big!).  It is even heating, wipes clean easily, BUT it is so heavy that it takes more than 2-hands to pour anything out.  So, if you are very strong or have a loving hubby to help you pour the juices or gravy into a separate bowl, this pan is for you.  I am thinking of buying the next size down for everyday cooking; it is otherwise over-the-top excellent. I had this skillet for a couple months now and I have to say that cast iron is the way to go especially when it comes to cooking chicken, beef, pork, etc. I still have stainless steel and hard anodized cookware but this cast iron skillet is my favorite because it sears to perfection where the steel and hard anodized cookware can\\'t. I regret not cooking with cast iron sooner. I seasoned it as soon as I got it home and that was really easy to do. It isn\\'t that difficult to maintain either. I clean it with only hot water and scrap it with bristle brush after the skillet is cooled. Then I dry it and even heat it a little to really make sure it dries completely. Don\\'t want any rust on it! If you take care of this skillet, it could last like 50 years. If you take care of non-stick aluminum cookware, it will last like 2 years before it starts peeling and chipping. I don\\'t have that completely non-stick coating yet but it is getting there. At first, my eggs stuck a little bit but now, I have seasoned it real nicely to the point where they come out amazing. And the more you use and season it, you start to get that smoother finish over the pebble finish. I give this skillet a 5 out of 5! Some people need to stop complaining that it is heavy. IT IS CAST IRON! And don\\'t penalize this skillet if you receive a broken skillet shipped to you. Penalize the shipping company. This is a high quality skillet but can break like any cast iron skillet if it dropped during shipment. Everything you could want in a fry pan.  Cooks food great.  Wish I had ordered sooner. Don\\'t hesitate to order. Got the twelve inch pan. At first I thought it looked too big and I was going to return it. Then I measured inside bottom of pan which is only ten inches which is fine for me. I decided to keep it because the bigger pans have the extra handles in the front which actually make it easier to handle then some of the smaller ones. They are all heavy, of course So far, I love the skillet. Heats evenly, cleans up nicely, browns things nicely. Going to get a small companion skillet. I now have all three sizes.  This one is the one I will use the most.  Lodge Logic makes a superior product.  Several of my friends have also bought one after seeing mine. My husband wanted a cast iron skillet, so I bought him this one for Christmas. It is great to fry chicken. I kept meaning to buy a cast iron skillet for the side burner on the barbecue grill for doing blackened fish etc.  This pan is working out beautifully.  I may have to get an even bigger one! Great Gift for those starting off using cast iron to cook with, this has got to be the 5th set of these I have bought for 5 different people, Lodge is a great product, it is pre-seasoned so you can use it right out of the box AND they are made in the USA.  you really can\\'t go wrong with any Lodge cast iron products. I\\'ve never used cast iron before, always using my regular non-stick skillets for searing, grilling, etc. The cast iron heats up remarkably fast, and maintains the heat so much better than my Circulon anodized skillets ever did. Bacon crisps up wonderfully, steaks sear beautifully, everything is just better with cast iron. Well, everything meat and/or vegetable. If you wanna cook up some eggs, stick with your regular non-stick pans. The pre-seasoning on these skillets is great, and will only get better with age. Just remember cast iron is heavy, and you will need to be extra careful if you have a glass cooktop to prevent scratching. This is by far my favorite frying pan!  I have used this same pan for 11 years now and it keeps getting better!! After I purchased this pan I stuck a dollop of Crisco in the pan and baked it in the pan to season it and now everytime I cook with it, I am more and more pleased at how food turns out. Has never rusted or pitted--great quality! Take good care of this pan and it will take care of itself!! My step daughter wanted a Cast iron pan so I saw this and ordered it for her. She loves it, very excited to receive it. Loves to cook in it, easy to use.. Only dislikes is the weight of it, but that\\'s to be expected of Cast iron. I would recommend this pan. So far so good!  I\\'m learning to relive my childhood by going back to cast iron.  I also have an induction cooktop so this is a bit of an adventure.  So far things are going well but I did discover that the induction temp needs to be a bit lower than normal for the cast iron or things burn too quickly.  The seasoning on the pan was ok but I had to reseason again as recommended by Lodge.  So far it worked out well and with the addition of some olive oil things aren\\'t sticking!  Yay!  Hopefully I will continue to enjoy using this pan for many years.  Oh it is a tad on the heavy side! Sometimes I like to roast dry spices, mustard seeds or peanuts, and this is just the right size pan for it.  Madhur Jaffrey recommends a cast iron skillet for spices, and this one is good for her recipes.My five year old also likes to borrow it to \"cook\" for her stuffed animals.It\\'s pretty too, in a rough hewn, primitive way.  No ornamentation whatsoever. This is a great, basic cast iron skillet.  What more do you want than that?  :)  It came nicely pre-seasoned, I use it all the time and it looks brand new after a nice, quick wipe down, rinse, and dry.  The red silicone hot handle was a nice addition and really does protect your hand from the heat quite well.  I bought this version specifically because it came with the handle (I didn\\'t feel it was worth it to by them separately) and I feel that it was worth it. 5 stars for cast iron, and 5 stars for Lodge.  Nevertheless, I found this \"15 inch\" skillet very difficult to cook with because it heats so unevenly.This skillet is massive so it is a very large heat sink.  I heat it on a 12.5\" electric cooktop element.  I have not seen too many elements (gas or electric) larger than this.On high heat, the center of the pan expands substantially and the outside so much less that the pan deforms and the bottom cones.  This exacerbates the uneven heating because as the pan deforms the edges lift off the cooktop and the pan teeters on the bulge in the center of the bottom, further heating the center and cooling the perimeter.  Gas burners do not need flat bottoms so much but they are usually smaller in diameter than my 12.5\" electric element and may also have trouble heating the perimeter.Pancakes didn\\'t work.  Even though I cooked 9-10\" diameter cakes, the perimeter of the pan works like a heat sink to draw heat away, leaving the center much hotter than even the circumferance of the pan bottom that is directly over the heating element.French toast didn\\'t work.  The difference between the center and the edges was enough to burn the toast in the center and leave the pieces around the edges undercooked.  Further cooking the edge pieces resulted in visible differences between the outside and inside edge of the piece (light to dark).I thought I could overcome the size and mass of this thing by preheating it and working with awareness of the thermodynamic problems it presents, but I have not had practical success so far.My reference pan is a well seasoned All Clad Cop-R-Chef 12\" fry pan.  The All Clad with its aluminum core heats very evenly.  Cast iron is much better than stainless for fried eggs, and this spacious 15\" pan would provide considerably more room for frying and could saute more without getting so crowded that the food gets steamed.I want it to work out, but I might have to downsize to the 13 inch skillet because I don\\'t see a practical way to heat a pan this large evenly. The pan is heavy and very high quality. I have a feeling it\\'ll still be around long after I\\'m gone. This is the perfect size for frying a couple of eggs or melting butter, or heating a bit of sauce. You will find a million uses for this sturdy little skillet. As with all American made Lodge products, the quality is excellent, with smooth surfaces throughout. Just like the larger skillet, I\\'m so happy to purchase something made in the USA. It\\'s heavy but great for one hamburger or saut&eacute;ing onions. Love it! I live alone and this is the perfect size. I also love the coating that has been applied, must be what they call pre-seasoned I always season my Lodge after I receive my piece.  Always pleased, and in Love with Lodge Cast Iron products. I have been wanting a cast iron skillet for so long but they were out of reason money wise. Able to get this one at a wonderful price and it was pre seasoned I love this little skillet. Nothing better than a pad of butter and a egg on top of it when you need a quick snack. It tastes so much better from a cast-iron skillet. The good part is, it gets better and better. This really cooks things up good and really cleans up nice once you have used it several times.  It seems like it gets better the more you use it. I\\'ve never owned an iron skillet before.  I love this thing.  We cook chicken breasts and steaks in it once or twice a week.  A few tips.  Never use soap to wash it.  I use Alton Brown\\'s salt cleaning method (just google it, there\\'s a video where he explains it).To cook steak, I use the 3/3/3 method.  Season the steak with some salt and pepper or a rub.  Let it sit for 10-20 minutes. Put a couple of drops of oil in the skillet.  Preheat the skillet in the oven (450-500 degrees).  Take the skillet out, and put it on the stovetop on high heat.  Put the steak in there for 3 minutes, then flip.  Wait another 3 minutes, then put the iron skillet in the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes.Chicken breasts are done the same way, except they\\'ll take about 10 minutes in the oven.  Use an oven thermometer to monitor the temperature of the chicken breasts.  It should get to 160-165 degrees in the thickest portion of the chicken breast.  I usually season the chicken with a rub. I really like it. I got mine from Amazon and it was in excellent shape when it arrived, no rust or funny coating like some other people have found. But don\\'t expect it to be just like a non-stick skillet or you\\'ll be disappointed - it does take some care and some breaking-in.Even though it\\'s pre-seasoned, I seasoned it further by heating oil in it to smoking a couple of times, and I still use a tiny bit of oil when I cook in it. And unlike non-stick pans, it\\'s iron and will rust, so after washing (water only, no soap) I dry it well and wipe it with a little Crisco. Every once in a while something sticks but a quick scrub with a scrubber sponge takes care of it.The surface is a little more pebbly than my 40-yr old, 12\" cast-iron skillet (which has a mirror-like finish and nothing ever sticks to it) so eggs were a bit of a challenge at first, but after using it for 6 months they rarely stick; over time as I cook with it, it gets better and better.  Maybe after 40 yrs. this one, too, will develop a mirror-like finish and absolute non-stick surface.The best part is, it\\'s safe, no chemical coatings. And my hemoglobin has always been high-normal. I purchased this skillet recently and was impressed with its design and heft.  I don\\'t use it every day by any stretch, but when I do need it, it works well.  This particular model also has a very useful 2nd carrying handle.  The additional handle is nice - helps avoid feeling like you need to hustle from point A to B, before anything bad happens :-)  Plus, it\\'s made in the USA! I own 2 of these little pans, 1 of them for over 30 years & the other had been my mom\\'s for many years beyond that.  Had I known back then what I know now (how many times have we all said that?), I would have bought mostly cast iron instead of all the other cookware.  It does take a little time to properly care for cast iron but it\\'s sooooo worth it to me.  These cast iron skillets turn out a great grilled cheese sandwich, too!  Just use a lid on the pan & be sure to cook only on medium-low heat.Several years ago my mom gave me a wonderful recipe (see below) to make cornbread on the stovetop in the 8\" skillet using a lid, flipping the cake over once the batter looks almost done to cook the other side.  You have to use 2 spatulas to flip it (the reason for using the 8\" skillet).  I tried flipping a 10\" ONCE & found it takes a better woman than I to get that right!  This technique makes a more moist & better cornbread according to my DH & me. Another added benefit is that you don\\'t have to heat up the oven/kitchen.In a small bowl, mix 1 cup of **self-rising white or yellow cornmeal, 1 Tbs. sugar (optional).  In a separate small bowl, whip 1 egg with fork & stir in 2/3 cup milk.  Add egg/milk mixture to cornmeal.  Stir together just until all is moist.  Melt 1 to 2 Tbs. shortening in skillet over medium heat.  Sprinkle pan with cornmeal (not too thick) stirring to brown it.  This will give you a crustier side.  Lower heat to medium-low & add batter to pan and cover.  Check batter & once it\\'s looking a little more done than a pancake would, flip the cake using 2 sturdy nylon spatulas.  I prefer to cover after flipping & it will be done in less than 5 more minutes.  For crustier bread leave lid off after flipping.  **Or use regular cornmeal with 2 tsp. aluminum free baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt in place of self-rising - I\\'m sort of guessing at these amounts as a replacement for self-rising.If you\\'d like to read my method of seasoning cast iron, go to the Lodge Biscuit pan and read my review there.Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Drop Biscuit PanMy DH laughs at me because of my admiration of raw cast iron, enameled cast iron and how I care for them.  I now have 2-10\", 1-12\", the biscuit pan, muffin pans, as well as the Lodge Pizza Pan.  The pizza pan makes a wonderful crust.  If we have left over pizza, we melt butter in one of the larger skillets over medium heat.  Put 2 or 3 slices in & cover with a lid.  Reduce heat to medium low.  It will take just a little patience but it will taste as if it were fresly baked.  You\\'ll probably stop warming pizza in the microwave. **SAFETY TIP**  since these pans get very hot and stay hot, keep children away and make sure you use a pot holder or something to grab. These pans stay hot even a half hour later after turning off burners! The handles can burn you so be careful. Cast iron do not cool off like a regular pan.The Lodge iron skillets are excellent. 1st off you need to know these are VERY HEAVY. So if you aren\\'t up to lifting and cooking with a pan that actually takes a bit of muscle don\\'t bother with these. I\\'m not saying these are the heaviest things in the world, just they are not weak little cheap pans. They do require some lift in your arm to use these. Keep in mind they are iron and a very heavy metal.So why would you want these heavy pans? because they get VERY HOT and they stay hot. I have a great set of stainless steal pans and they never get this hot or retain their heat. I also have a very nice set of non stick, they are nice and great for certain cooking.These pans though are ideal for meats, searing, sausage, hamburger, all sorts of dishes that require high consistent heat. Another point is these pans should last a lifetime or longer. They are simple and durable...just a piece of metal that gets very hot and does what you need in the kitchen.This again is one of the many reason people love cooking with these pans.. they get very hot and stay hot. Any serious cook should have a set or a couple to use for those special homemade recipes mom or grandma used to make. These pans are where it\\'s at! I have the 12 inch version of this pan and I love it!  This eight inch little guy is a great addition to my cast iron arsenal - great for eggs or saut&eacute;ing shallots for gravy.  The Lodge brand is reliable and USA made! I\\'ve only started cooking with iron again in the last month or so. I have several good nonstick saute pans in stainless and mixed steel/copper, but they just don\\'t hold the same energy that this pan does. When you\\'re searing or sauteing, you need the pan to not cool off dramatically when you\\'re adding food, and the mass of this pan means that the temperature drop is minimized. While you\\'re cooking, it also means that the temperature is more consistent edge to edge. This pan is heavy, but that\\'s what makes it work so well. I made a pan-seared steak this evening, which can be challenging to cook properly, but through consistent heating and predictability, it was easy in this skillet. I\\'d definitely buy it again. Perfect as a paperweight, paper clip holder.  Could be used as ash tray.  Great conversation piece on my desk at work.  Might be a good piece for doll house decoration or builders of miniatures. This is an amazing skillet. Great for making steaks at home or even a good burger indoors instead of grilling outside. Very good value for the money.Dont waste money on the more expensive skillets as this is more than enough to make quality food at home. Love the extra handle for easier lifting of the skillet. Wish the surface was a little smoother. This size about completes my set of cast-iron skillets and pans. Thinking abouit purchasing the 11-inch Logic deep fryer skillet. Also looking for 1-quart sauce pan. Love cast-iron; long lasting and easy to take care of. Soap is not necessary. Non-stick is pretty good and has gotten better every time I use it. For the price I doubt it can be beaten. Cast iron skillet every kitchen needs one and this is a good one, just take care of it right and it will last forever. Preseasoned yes, but I gave it a little extra TLC based on past experience.  Did cornbread, turned the skillet upside down and the cornbread dropped right out by its ownself (as it\\'s said in these here parts :-) This is a great skillet, but is very very larger....I don\\'t think a normal stove burner can handle this big boy! Every serious cook needs a 12\\' cast iron skillet. Properly seasoned, it is totally non-stick, cleaning up with a casual flick of a paper towel. If need be it can be scrubbed down to bare metal and reseasond. Try THAT with teflon! I have been known to over use the \"high heat\" setting, and happens that from time to time, billows of smoke emerge from my kitchen. If that\\'s from a cast iron pan, it\\'s merely a ruined meal. If it\\'s my late, unlamented teflon-coated wok... it goes in the garbage WITH the ruined meal.This particular design is a perennial for many reasons. It would be found hanging from the side of chuckwagons and in the kitchens of great homes. It works equally well on gas, charcoal, wood fires and electric stoves, so it\\'s a camping essential.It\\'s rim is high enough to use as a saucepan - and that\\'s where the term \"pan gravy\" comes from. Controllable, even heat is the secret to good gravy - and of course, meat juices.It\\'s equally at home in the oven as on the stove - unlike many composite-handled stainless steel skillets. The crust of a pie baked in cast iron is equal to or superior to Pyrex.A twelve-inch steak and whatever pie, four inches deep will feed six to eight people easily.It will also fry six eggs at a time; doing duty as a griddle.All told, this skillet is one of the most generally useful items in the kitchen. Mine never leaves the right front burner of my stove. The initial factory seasoning is probably little more than a rust inhibitor.  I bought this pan specifically to make corn bread.  The first attempt stuck to the pan even after a good coating of veg. oil.  I have coated and baked the pan alone several times and I know I have to be patient to get a real non stick surface.  Over time, it will be worth the effort. I bought this pan in a store for twice what it cost on Amazon, but it\\'s such a great product I have no regrets.This is superb for searing meat and stir fries and so on, and the non-stick capacity improves with each use (with none of the adverse health issues assoicated with modern non-stick surfaces that are so easy to damage).Cleanup on this product is a breeze.  After use just wash with a brush, don\\'t use soap, dry, and either heat it on the burner to get rid of any remaining water on the surface (which is what I do) or spray it with a cooking spray such as Pam (or lightly rub it with cooking oil and a paper towel [I don\\'t do it this way because it seems unnecesary, but it\\'s what\\'s recommended, perhaps in more humid climates like at the ocean than the one I live in]).It\\'s very nice that you can buy a Cook\\'s Illustrated top performer at such a very reasonable price. It\\'s a frying pan.  What\\'s to say?  It does work well and the extra handle on the back side is great for lifting.  Make sure you don\\'t wash it with detergents and just give it a slight oil coating after each washing.... hasn\\'t rusted and works fine.  Keeps the wife and kids in line, too. When my housemate moved out and took his skillet with him, I replaced it immediately.  Cooks three eggs every morning so perfectly your household will queue up to use it. I already have the 8 inch skillet and love it.  I now ordered the 12 inch skillet to replace my Farberware.  After I ordered the 12 inch I read more reviews as I couldn\\'t wait to receive it and only then did I read that the 12 inches refers to the diameter from outer edge (angled) to outer edge and NOT the inner cooking surface.  Well, I started to panic that the inner dimension is only 10 inches and not the 12 I felt I was replacing.Great news:  when I just ten minutes ago received the pan I put it on my stove and laid my Farberware \"12\" inch skillet inside.  How typical, I assumed my Farberware was 12 inches, but low and behold, it measures only ten inches on the outer dimension and slightly less on the inside.  I NOW have 12 inch skillet with a slightly larger than 10 inch cooking surface which is about an inch bigger than what I thought I had in the Farberware piece.I am soooo glad I didn\\'t order the 15 inch Lodge skillet or I would actually have a pan that I could not fit on my glass cooktop and would not have been able to use, not to mention the extra four pounds for the bigger pan and an additional $15 pricetag.LESSON:  Measure your pan.  I was lucky and got what I really needed and not what I thought I needed.  You might not be so lucky if you don\\'t measure first.The 12 inch Lodge pan has a 10 inch cooking surface.  It is 12 inches on the outside from lip to lip.Please be careful because with cast iron you do need EXACTLY the right size for your glass stovetop as you can\\'t have an overhang of more than one inch or the stovetop can break as per manufacturers instructions.UPDATE:  I have had this pan for a little over 4 years now.  What a difference.  This is the pan I use about 95% of the time.  It sits on my stovetop full time and never leaves.  I cook in it twice a day, sometimes three times.  About a year ago I was getting frustrated because all the non-stick abilities were gone and I was getting little black pieces of \"seasoning\" in all my foods.  Eggs especially were no longer appetizing.  I quickly realized that by washing it with a scrub sponge and soap was erradicating my pan of its seasoning. In addition, the inside of the pan was looking like it was starting to rust.  I gave it a quick and thorough cleaning to get all the loose seasoning off and I have since been using only a soft sponge with little soap, and after that, heating up the pan for a minute (at most) with a little olive oil coating the pan.  Once it heats up, I turn off the burner and take a paper towel and wipe up any extra oil that might be in the pan.  Voila!  I once again have a beautiful non-stick pan that I love so much.  I really can\\'t say enough about it.  I never did get the All-Clad that I was so wanting and couldn\\'t be happier.If you want my advice...  If you are thinking about getting this pan and are sitting on the fence thinking it\\'s alot of work, please get it and see for yourself.  It\\'s not a big deal to keep it nice and it cooks the food wonderfully.  Steaks and seafood especially.  You will never get the same sear on your meats in a stainless skillet.  For anything that needs to be steamed, I simply add liquid, put the cast iron lid that I bought separately on top and veggies steam right in the pan.I really can\\'t say enough good things about cast iron cookware. Lasts forever. If you want - you can always sandpaper it down and re-season it. Just read online about how to use a cast iron skillet. I saw this pan at the outlet store in Wrenthem MA for $80 and thought that was a good deal....i got this as a gold box discount for under $40. The pan is outstanding and cooks like a cast-iron skillet should...highly recommend this over paying a lot of money for a name brand skillet. What a wonderful pan!  I have cast iron that was my grandmother\\'s and this is just as nice.  I love to cook steak in a cast iron skillet.  Get the pan really hot, season the steak and put it in the pan.  It cooks quickly and tastes great. I have this pan and a 10\" version. I never use this (12\") pan. The 10\" is so much more manageable and practical. The 12\" only gets used on rare occasions when I need a really big pan. I didn\\'t think the difference would be that significant, but it is. Many burners can\\'t really even accommodate this large of a pan. If you\\'re only looking for one cast iron pan, a 10\" is the way to go.As far as quality goes, there is no question. Fantastic pan. When I began life as a grad student and moved cross-country into my new apartment, I brought precious little in the way of kitchen equipment.  While I spent endless hours researching the relative merits of hard-anodized and stainless steel-clad cookware, I decided to pick this skillet up in the meantime because it looked A) inexpensive, B) easy to use, and C) pretty darn near indestructible.Three months later, we rarely use anything else!It works equally well for melting cheese on nachos or baking bread in the oven as it does for stir-frying vegetables and cooking omelets on the range.  The pre-seasoning process really works, and if the skillet is cared for properly (gentle handwashing, avoiding too high heat, always stored dry), the nonstick properties of the cooking surface only improve with time.  Do note that cast iron probably isn\\'t for you if you just want to throw it in the sink overnight after use - it\\'ll be a rusty mess the next day, and while this is fairly easy to correct with steel wool and a little effort, cast iron really shouldn\\'t be treated this way.Cast iron is safe for use on a glass-top range; some range manufacturers recommend against it, but if you\\'re careful not to drop or drag the skillet on the surface, it won\\'t cause any damage (see comments).  If you\\'re still concerned about scratching, check out enameled cast iron:Lodge Enameled Cast-Iron 11-Inch Skillet, Cafe Brown THIS SKILLET CAME PRE-SEASONED AND READY TO GO WITH WONDERFUL INSTRUCTIONS. CAN\\'T WAIT TO MAKE THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN THE WORLD. I would recommend this pre seasoned skillet to anyone looking for a really nice fry pan.  You do not have to wait to season, just start using. Performed as promised. Great weight and balance. May need a couple of uses before it is truly seasoned. Be sure and follow directions on cleaning and storage. This skillet is an amazing value for such a high quality and useful tool.Literally every piece of meat that I cook is now cooked in this pan. It\\'s like magic- everything comes out tasting like it\\'s from a restaurant. Chicken, steak, burgers, fish (seared tuna is amazing on from this skillet), you name it.Cleaning cast iron after cooking is 5x easier than stainless steel. When I\\'m done, I just scrape it with a metal pan scraper (also sold on Amazon) to get the big debris off (be careful not to scratch the skillet with the corners of the scraper). Next, I ball up 2 paper towels and gently scrub off the finer debris. Then I put the skillet back on the burner for ~30 seconds and rub it again with the paper towels. No water is used. It\\'s so easy!Cleaning it like this leaves enough of the oils behind to keep the skillet seasoned, and makes it so every meal that you cook tastes better than your last.I love my cast iron skillet. I have wanted a smaller size cast iron frying pan and am so glad I sent for this one.  The  pan is very well made  has held up very well for the many uses already.  Quality pan!! I\\'ve used Lodge before. But Beware- this size pan is HUGE! you could cook a whole chicken in it! We have a small lodge and I wanted the next size up- never thought to measure. I don\\'t know how or when we would ever use this size pan. Won\\'t fit on two burners. We have gas stove. Too big for one burner. One of my favorites This was the first Lodge pan I bought and I am now completely sold on cast iron. In fact, I have replaced all of my non-stick cookware with old-fashioned Lodge products because of their even cooking capabilities, ease of cleaning and the ability to use them outdoors on an open fire or grill... Plus you just can\\'t beat the amazing value you\\'re getting. I LOVE my cast iron skillet!  It was so convenient having it pre-seasoned and with such a great quality for the price, I wouldnt buy from another brand :) Definitely recommend this skillet! My husband and I got our first cast iron pan about a year ago. We promptly ruined it by not being able to clean it. I think we made some kind of quiche in it and it had ridges...anyway, we completely ruined it after just one use. We\\'ve been learning to cook more lately and needed a cast iron skillet for some of our recipes. I decided to try this one out since the price was right. I read somewhere in one of the reviews a good way to clean it. They suggested rinsing it in hot water immediately after using it, boiling some water in it (we let it boil while we eat), dumping the boiling water, scrubbing it and then drying it immediately. We\\'ve used it about five times now, cleaning it right away and we\\'re happy to report that it\\'s in perfect condition. We love this pan. It\\'s very heavy and seems very durable. I love cooking with cast iron.  Now I\\'ve cooked with cast iron a long time, and one thing I have discovered is that it is best to have a pan for cooking strong tasting meats like fish or cajun dishes.  I use this pan for pretty much all other meats, and it works extremely well.The one extremely important property that needs to be added is simply the fact that you will want a metal spatula to go with your cast iron cookware.  Usually, a small scraping action is enough to separate the food from the skillet, but a plastic spatula just won\\'t cut it in that regard.  Also, a plastic spatula will likely melt given how well cast iron retains heat. I only have one pan and its this one.  I love iron skillets, I\\'ve used them during the college years.  I just don\\'t trust the teflon/non stick coatings, it worries me very much.  As a student I couldn\\'t afford the high end pans, so I went with the next best thing, iron.  I still use these, makes me feel like a man in the kitchen, ha-ha.MADE IN THE USA I purchased this skillet and absolutely love it. It is big, heavy, and solid. Despite being \"pre-seasoned\" I still chose to season it with lard and I am glad that I have. This thing feels like it will last forever and a little extra TLC will keep happy.Absolutely recommend. Use this on a routine basis. High quality and works great! Pros:Heavy iron that distributes and maintains heat well.Excellent size that will fit up to 4 burgers simultaneously.Excellent price for a made-in-america product.Come preseasoned, but I still applied 6 coats of flax seed oil, baking it in the oven for 30 minutes between applications.Better than every teflon pan I\\'ve ever used.Best cooking utensil I\\'ve ever owned because the browning is incomparable to other pans I\\'ve owned. This is the only thing to use for making home fries.It can also be used as a dutch oven if you buy the lid.Also great for camping or defending yourself.Cons:Not for weak wrists and may require two hands to move it off the stove.Doesn\\'t work in the microwave. After years of cooking and buying and replacing non-stick cookware, I decided I\\'d try a return to cast iron. I had previously purchased a Dutch Oven and I was happy with the results and decided I could no longer do without a cast iron skillet. I love cooking in it and can do a steak in the oven that is as good as any that comes off the grill. And that\\'s a heck of a lot easier when the snow\\'s flying. I looked around and Lodge has the best price. I\\'m sure the more expensive brands are great but just too rich for my budget. I don\\'t see this skillet breaking down in my lifetime and then some. I took one star off as I don\\'t find the seasoning that comes on the Lodge products to stand up well. It\\'s no real problems for me as I actually enjoy seasoning my cast iron myself and it just involved an extra step of stripping off the pre-seasoning which was easily accomplished. There are many ways to do this. I used oven cleaner-sprayed it on, wrapped it in plastic, and went to bed. Scrubbed it out easily the next morning and proceeded on to my seasoning method. It is now beautifully seasoned and I\\'ve used it with great results for months now. Will be ordering a larger one as soon as finances permit another purchase. I would recommend this product for everyone.  It cooks so evenly and food doesn\\'t burn like in other light-weight frying pans.  If you don\\'t like heavy frying pans, this is not for you.  It is heavy, but worth it. Worth the price.  Nice big 12\" skillet, no flaws in the casting, factory seasoning not that great.  The skillet heats relatively evenly once it comes up to temp.  I have an infrared thermometer I check it with.  There is about a 30-50 degree drop from the center to the edge on a kitchen burner.  I think the sides soak up some of the heat and that\\'s what causes the drop, not a bad casting; it\\'s not a griddle.  Bigger higher btu burner on the side of the grill heats it a little more evenly.  Factory seasoning was okay...  No rust no metal smell after I washed the stain off from the label.  It will need a some more seasoning right out of the box before it reaches it\\'s full potential.  There were a few nicks in the seasoning on the top edges and the tip of the handle.  Most likely from getting banged around in shipping.  Cooked some bacon first, it did stick a little in a dry skillet but no big deal to get it loose.  Cleaned the skillet with hot water and a stiff brush; no soap although I do use a small amount from time to time.  Fried some good quality frozen 1/4 lb burgers the next day.  Threw the frozen burgers 2 at a time on a 500 degree pre heated skillet (infrared thermometer is awesome) with no sticking problems.  The first flip required a little persuasion to loose but no real effort was required.  Burgers turned out great.I have since added several layers carbon and the seasoning is pretty good to go at this point.  I seasoned by cleaning it with a small amount of dish washing soap and hot water.  After it\\'s bone dry I add as thin a layer of soybean oil as possible over mostly just the cooking surface.  The sides, bottom, and handle don\\'t need much attention.  Put in a cold oven (I alternate facing up and down each time I do this) and set to 400.  Once it reaches temp I\\'ll let it bake for at lest an hour not more than two.  The idea with seasoning is to build thin layers of carbon on top of the iron.  What you want to be careful of is too not build layers of fat polymer chains instead of carbon.  If it looks glossy and it\\'s somewhat tacky that\\'s polymer chains and that\\'s not what you want.  Note properly well seasoned cast iron will look a little glossy too.  If it looks kind of oily and not too shiny you\\'ve got a properly seasoned piece of cast iron and it\\'s up to it\\'s full \"non stick\" potential.  The picture posted of the guys old skillet is a good example of this.  If it\\'s really shiny, similar to the paint on a car.  That\\'s your layer of polymer chains and it probably doesn\\'t perform well.  Only way to fix this is to strip down to bare iron and re-season properly.Bottom line...  Good skillet for the price but factory seasoning is not perfect.  Put a little work into it, clean and store it properly and it will serve you well.  I would also recommend buying an infrared thermometer.  You can find a half descent one for under $30.  Amazon sells a $***load of them. price - very gooddelivery - finepre-seasoned - sort ofcontruction - solidly built and the little one (8&#34;) is actually kind of cutenon-stick - not yet, but... working on by cleaning it after every use, not applying any soap, and not cooking acidics things in it like tomatoes, and coating it with oil before and after each use.has required a note in it to remind other household members not to use it yet. and means I have to be very, very good about immediate clean up (boil some water in it after cooking eggs to get the white up). It is just that I know this can/should work so am trying to get some iron and a more traditional (less toxic) non-stick finish.But, don\\'t kid yourself, it takes attention and intention. Coat with vegetable shortening,place on top of coal or wood burning stove,cook for three to five days.I have a Harman Mark 1 coal stove, this stove will boil water in a tea pot. The finished seasoning is a lot better than I ever obtained in a oven. When I have the coal stove fired up every winter I reseason all of my cast iron. I\\'ve been using my cast iron pans for several years, both in the home and while camping. I won\\'t cook with anything else. The only drawback to cast iron is the weight, but use them for a few months and you won\\'t even notice anymore.Unlike other pans that warp over time, or come warped from the factory, the cast iron always rests flat on the stove burners. That is so important. The heat spreads evenly across the pan\\'s cooking surface. You\\'ll never have hot and cold spots that cause burning and under cooking. The spout on the lip makes it easy to pour off liquids and grease.I\\'ve never had a problem using soap on my cast iron pans. I can\\'t stand the black grime left behind when I only wipe out the pan with only a damp paper towel. I use soap and a scrubber to clean them. They stay seasoned regardless. Maybe that\\'s because I cook a lot of bacon and eggs, and the grease re-seasons the pan each time. They are very easy to clean...and to re-season when necessary.Nothing burns unless I mistakenly burn it. If you\\'re new to cast iron, it takes a bit of time getting used to them. They really retain the heat. Once you turn off the heat source, the food continues to cook.I love that I can cook directly over the wood campfire with these pans. There\\'s no worry about melting, cracking or warping. Cast iron withstands the test of time. Once you start cooking in cast iron you will throw all your other pans away. You\\'ll soon understand why our grandmothers cherished them. I love this iron skillet!!  I have always wanted one you can\\'t beat how it cooks your food!!  Would recommend! I have cast iron pans big and smal, deep and shallow, a handy glass covered one, flat and ribbed cookers of various sorts, pancake cookers, pots, water heater, cornbread cookers, bacon flattener. Must have 100 lbs of cast iron stuff, all sorts of brands, some antique. Some that are enameled. Maybe more than 100 lbs.I should get a reward from the Cast Iron Association.A lot of it just happened, given to me, a few antique bargains, an inherited set and so on. I didn\\'t set out to do this and I am not a fanatic about it. But, I use them almost exclusively, along with stainless pots and such.But, oddly, I had no medium sized pan. Was ordering socks, saw this, applied a credit and here it is, ready for a lot of use.I have several Lodge items, all good. Made in USA. Great skillet, great price. There\\'s nothing not to love about this skillet. It seems practically indestructible. As long as we take care of it, I don\\'t think we\\'ll ever need to buy another one. What a gift to have a cast-iron pan that didn\\'t need initial seasoning.  I love the even heating and the thickness of the pan.  I\\'ve had my pans for years and just keep adding newer sizes.  With all of the expensive cookware on the market, it\\'s nice to have found something inexpensive that works great. I purchased this little skillet for my husband who likes to make one egg over lightly every so often. I already have the 10.25 skillet and the square grill pan. All Lodge. This is a wonderful little pan and it is so easy to use. It does come pre-seasoned, but I gave it another seasoning after washing (no soap) before first use. I just place it on my NuWay Pic2 induction burner at 350 degrees.....just a little while until you can really feel the heat reaching all the way to the handle. I season it with a light coat of olive oil and let it sit for a bit. I wipe out the excess oil and store. I have been doing this every time I use the skillet (it takes such a little while), and the results are almost completely non-stick. I make a cheese omelet in it for myself and it just glides......no sticking issues, even with the cheese. The pan heats very evenly and quickly. It makes a big difference with the taste of the food. Wish I could explain it!!!!! It is so much healthier than using Teflon and other assorted non-stick coatings. It is not necessary to use extremely high heat because the cast iron is so efficient in spreading the temperature evenly. Medium high is the highest I ever go on my induction burner.  This is a very high quality product at a terrific price. As others have said, with proper care, you will NEVER have to replace it. This 6.5 inch size is perfect for small portions for one person. Obviously, if you have to prepare more food, then go for the size appropriate to your meal. The larger pans are quite heavy, but the extra handle is very useful so that you can carry them more easily. I plan on purchasing the 8 inch Lodge skillet as well. By the way, my husband loves preparing his food in this and swears it really does taste so much better. Who am I to argue. I highly recommend this excellent product. Exactly as advertised.  Arrived early, and packaged well.  I needed a new skillet, and this is the perfect size, and came pre-seasoned. I have many Lodge cast iron pieces, and this is just perfect for handling. My 12\" is quite heavy and I get it out only when I have a huge amount of food to prepare. My 6 1/2\"  is great for corn bread for two in the toaster oven. No worries with a cast iron skillet about preheating to a screaming hot temperature, as you would have with a non-stick coated pan. Crank it up! Sear those chops and steaks. Don\\'t forget the Char Crust.Char Crust Hickory Grill Rub - 4ozThis is perfect for a two person meal. Two small steaks or two chops. (OK, light eaters). Nothing like really well grilled onions and mushrooms in cast iron. Pre-seasoned means not having to mess with oiling and hours of baking in the oven to get the nice coating. Always wash this cast iron with only water and a good scrub brush. Never use soap or you will have to start over with the seasoning procedure. Lodge quality just can\\'t be beat. Amazon of course has the best prices too. PS, I tried the handle pot holders and they work OK, but if you leave them on the handle, they do get hot, and there is always a danger that they will get too close to the flame on a gas stove. They are not fire proof. I read that some grilling mitts could withstand up to 450 degrees or so, and that\\'s good, but ove gloveOve\\' Glove Hot Surface Handler, 1 Glove (Pack of 2)withstands up to 540 degrees. I got those. Better to go for the max temp protection. This is a great skillet for on top of the stove or in the oven (or both). You can\\'t beat cast iron. Only down side is that they are heavy; the lip or &#34;hook&#34; opposite the handle makes it easier to lift but you\\'ll need oven mitts.  The 12&#34; pan is probably the most useful size. This is my fourth lodge pan and has not ruined my previous opinion of the product.  It is truly pre-seasoned and after a couple of hours in the oven with a coat of oil, I can easily flip eggs without breaking the yolks.  Highly recommend. I purchased this pan nearly a year ago, and am now adding to my set. I actually grew up with cast iron frying pans, but it has taken me some time to get used to using them again. I highly recommend these to anyone concerned about the chemicals that leach into your food from non-stick coating or traditionalists or even someone who wants to invest in a pan that will last you a lifetime and never need replacing. You can\\'t break them, you can\\'t ding them, and they won\\'t warp. As long as you take care of them, they will not rust. And you probably get some minor iron intake from cooking in them regularly.Follow the manufacturers instructions about not using soap is the most important thing. Use a stainless steel scouring pad or other scrubber (brush, chain mail) to remove food shortly after cooking. I find that if I leave them dirty on the stove for a day or two, the food debris sort of act as moisture on the pan and can create rust.If you ever get a rust spot, scrub it immediately, dry the pan thoroughly (I like to put mine on the stove for 2 minutes on low to warm the pan and evaporate any moisture), and re-oil it lightly with olive oil or coconut oil on a paper towel. This includes the bottom, which may not make sense to anyone who is grease fire fearful, but we are talking about a light coating to seal out moisture, the pan should look dark on the outside, not shiny or dripping.My best suggestion is to fry bacon! Yes, fry bacon in each pan when you first get it. Although they are pre-seasoned, it is a light seasoning that needs to be reinforced with something greasy several times before you start to develop a deeper seasoning. Before this, you will find that foods will stick, aka, eggs. Stick with the pans, and they will not stick to your food after some time!  Keep to oily foods like bacon, ground beef, or frying something in oil, etc, until you see them darken up a bit, or even follow the manufacturer\\'s instructions on reseasoning, but do it a few times in a row.It will probably take more than a year of regular use for these pans to develop that smooth bottom that you may remember your mama\\'s pans had, but with proper care and oiling, they will be no-stick within a few weeks or months. Always use a bit of cooking oil or butter when you heat them up before adding food, unless it\\'s bacon.Best of all, there is no need for plastic utensils to avoid scratching non-stick coating. You can use stainless steel or wooden! Nice small skillet for small jobs. This skillet takes up little storage space, and is handy for personal size meals. Some think cast iron cookware is work to keep up and clean. It isn\\'t. Other than BBQing, cast iron is one of the best ways to get that same seared, BBQ quality. Because it heats quickly, holds heat and conducts evenly, you have the ability to produce juicy steaks. I have 8, 12 and a whopping 22 inch skillet. And yes, I wash my cast iron skillet, dry it and then I put it in a warm oven or heat it on the stove to ensure the moisture is out of the pan, so it doesn\\'t rust. In my opinion, it\\'s a healthier way to cook compared to aluminium or non-stick. In fact, I also use enamel coated cast iron cookware for stews, sauces, etc. Regular cast iron is not well suited for acidic foods, for those get the enamel coated. This skillet is heavy-duty, solid, and built to last.  It comes pre-seasoned which is nice, but I always apply a thin layer of oil on the cooking surface before use as well as after to keep things cooking beautifully.  Being cast iron, a little TLC goes a long way to keep this skillet in great shape to cook all your food to perfection.  Whether you use the skillet on a stovetop or grill top, this skillet will not disappoint.  I love that it\\'s got the safety/carry handle opposite the hold-handle, and the pour-spout is a very handy feature.  The price I paid was an absolute steal, especially since I could easily get rid of most of my other cookware and use just this piece to cook everything in.  A great item to have in anyone\\'s cookware arsenal! Cast iron is great for heating and cooking food of all types. The first time I cooked eggs they were the best I\\'d EVER had! The tough part is remembering to clean it right after using and NOT letting it sit in water EVER!! It will rust. It\\'s also important to keep a coat of oil on the pan to help with cooking, nonstick, and anti-rusting. I would recommend this pan to a friend for sure. We use cast-iron cookware in our camping trailer.  This is a good brand, and although I could have purchased it locally in a brick-and-mortar store, it was cheaper here.  A great pan. I was able to make a meal for six adults in this one skillet. Obviously it\\'s sturdy and didn\\'t have season it right away. The handle fits well but does slide a little if your grip isn\\'t tight enough. I got this as a Christmas gift for my son in law.  I dont know if he as used it yet but I havent heard any complaints yet. From checking at other places this was an exceptional price. While it can be intimidating to see this big black pan sitting on your stove, once you start using your cast iron you\\'ll wonder what else you can cook in it.  Treat it right and read the directions and these pans will last forever! Love it, Love it, Love it.  Buy it!!!!!  You will not be sorry.  Just follow instructions about never using soap and alwasy greasing before and after use either with oil or grease, and you cannot go wrong.  This skillet is huge and I love it.  I mean it is BIG.  Perfect for me and what I wanted.  I can cook four fried eggs all at the same time and they don\\'t come close to touching each other.  Normally I have to cook his and then mine, so this lets us eat together. This is a Herculean skillet, right here. Thank heavens it has the handle assist, because even empty (not to mention with hot, sizzling food in it) it would be near impossible to lift. I purchased this to cook huge batches of meat at once, and it did the trick. Problem is, after that project was done there isn\\'t really much else to use it for. I cook for just me, so obviously this would be too big for everyday use. If you have a big family, cook bulk meals, or want to go cook on a campfire, this is the skillet for you. Take good care of it and it\\'ll last several generations. Not to mention it is a great, low cost security feature for your home. Hang it on the wall, and whenever someone tries to break in give their head a good bashing  (or two). This pan was at a great price, and is reliable and sturdy. It is made to last, and no problems with it rusting out. My sister uses it and uses it and it is made to last. Great quality purchase for the price!!! Works great.  Use it all the time.  Its a little heavy and generally requires 2 hands, but its worth it. These pans are not super-amazing, professional-grade cookware.I hope you didn\\'t expect that, especially considering the price.But they are just fine, and will perform well, given proper care and regular use.We make pizza in it, and the boys love it.Also great for eggs, tortillas, ground beef, and stir-fried veggies.First of all, disregard the \"pre-seasoned\" bit in the product name.This is to keep it from rusting, not for making a great cooking surface.When you get the pan, wash it thoroughly, scrubbing the inside with a rough rag or really fine steel wool (like #0000).Then coat it with lard (rendered from bacon), and bake it upside down (with a baking sheet underneath) at 250F for about three hours.This will give you a good start on building a great cooking surface or \"season\", which is really polymerized lipids.Then just use the pan a lot.  Cook lots of really fatty stuff in it.  Use a stainless-steel spatula with a smooth edge.Simply wipe out with a paper towel between uses, whenever possible.If it gets really dirty (e.g. has lots of charred black bits in it), use a washcloth and water to clean it up.Never use soap (some people talk about \"light\" soaps and what not; I say no soap at all).Never leave it wet.  I recommend sticking it back on the stove for a few minutes to dry it.Eventually, you\\'ll fill in all the little nooks/crannies/pits with polymerized lipids and have a fantastic pan.Don\\'t give up; it\\'s worth the effort. If you are buying cast iron, think about the weight first and how many in your household.  Lodge is always my top choice, being reasonably priced and made in USA.  I pretty much stopped using my 3 Calphalon non stick skillets at this point.Here\\'s my take on the ones I own:3qt oven: heavy heavy heavy but the taller wall is good for small batch frying and small stewing jobs10\" skillet: nice surface size; perfect for grilling a big T bone or 2/3 chicken breasts/top sirloins (get a silicone cover for simmering.  This is also my pizza pan, perfect for my counter-top oven.  The medium size pizza is good for 2 people.9\" grill skillet: strictly for grilling without blackening (the space between the grill is a wonderful heat transferer) therefore not a multifunctional piece8\" skillet: the size is the top not the bottom (the grilling surface); this is the perfect size for a big pancake, a waffle, or a personal size pizza.  It is also easier to lift and flip by spatula (vs. the mini skillet).  Most importantly, it is light enough for a woman to handle with one hand!8\" round meat press: if you see one, get it because it is a must for getting flat bacons.  I use it a lot!mini skillet: the size of a small pancake, a sunny-side-up, and a personal corn bread.  It is a wonderful solo skillet for cooking, serving, and baking.  Down side is that it is harder to flip sides using a spatula. This is a nice heavy skillet and it\\'s so nice to be able to use it on so many cooking surfaces.  It cleans nicely and makes DELICIOUS cornbread!  I think I\\'ll need to get a bigger one though.  It\\'s a little small for my family of 6. Came preseasoned and is the perfect size for my stove. I have a smooth top stove and it\\'s hard to find a frying pan that won\\'t warp. I love this skillet! This is a great American made product. If you already have used or own cast iron cookware then you need no advise. If you have never used this type of cookware then go to the Lodge website. They have vidoes on how to use and maintain the cookware. I would recommend buying the lid when you buy a pan. I didn\\'t and within 2 weeks had to order a lid, many recipes I found called for one. Most recipies call for a 10 or 12 inch size pan so the ingredients should be slightly increased or the cooking time adjusted for the extra area the recipe will spread over. Shipped promptly.  So far is pretty easy to wipe clean but remember not to use wire scrubber or soap in this seasoned skillet which makes absolutely perfect eggs, etc......  Bought the silicone handle in red which complements the skillet.  Only negative if that is the heaviness.  This thing is solid!!  Great pan which am sure will last me for many years. My wife likes to brown meat in the skillet and that put in oven to finish cooking.  This skillet fits the bill.  It is a quality item and should last forever. Just like granny used! Nothing else compares to cast iron...it just does\\'nt. This skillet is something you could hand down for generatiions. You\\'ll never wear it out, can\\'t say that about much these days. I only cooked bacon and ground hamburger in this for the first 10ish times. I still really only use it for bacon and to fry things like Mozzarella sticks. My BF thinks that meat tastes metallic when cooked in this, but I don\\'t taste it. I think if you have a small burner you might have problems with this size. And it\\'s heavy. Love it though. I didn\\'t expect this skillet to be so small. My roommate was joking with me that I can only use it to melt butter. But, I found it is very handy and useful for me! I never learned how to fry eggs. It always ends up like a scrambled eggs ( which I hate scrambled eggs!) Now I can make such a nice and round fried eggs!!!! Also if you are just preparing a meal for one, this little thing is very practical. One last thing, it is much easier to treat than those heavy big skillets. I bought 3 different sizes skillets, so far this is the one that I use the most! I have a Lodge cast iron skillet for a long time and I love it,I it use for baking,frying,sauteing,stir fry,anything.It\\'s so versatile and food always taste better,so I got this as a housewarming gift for my friends for their new house.I ordered this on a Friday and by Tuesday,it is right on my doorstep,right on tiime for their housewarming party this weekend.Fast delivery,can\\'t beat that! I\\'ve never owned an Iron Skillet before and I\\'m really glad I purchased this one.  It\\'s heavy and high quality at a great price.  It does take a little while to get to the temperature required for cooking but that is a characteristic of all iron skillets so it can\\'t be penalized for that.  You do have to oil the pan before you use it to avoid food sticking to it and I think that is to be expected.  There might be a better way to use it that doesn\\'t require oil, but I\\'m a novice cook at best so I just do what works.  Looking forward to cooking potatoes and other items in this! This is my first cast iron skillet so there has been a little bit of a learning curve in the proper way to maintain it.The skillet feels extremely heavy duty. Its very nice quality and gets the job done. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a nice cast iron skillet. I\\'m looking forward to trying other Lodge Logic products. This lodge skillet is great as usual and I have never had any issue with any of Lodge\\'s products. I would highly recommend this as it can be used on the stove, in the oven, over the fire, or on the grill. My wife loves this thing.. for some reason her eggs taste better when she cooks them in this pan.. A good buy! LOVE!! LOVE!! Love this skillet!!When we first got this we tried using it all the time and now we really still try to squeeze it in whenever. Great skillet to own, cooks everything perfectly, you are sure to be extremely satisfied with it!I would buy again and i would definitely recommend it. For the price this is amazing. There are not smooth like the old school cast iron skillets but that was to be expected. I haven\\'t had any issues with the seasoning but I still did my own seasoning to follow up. I love skillet cooking.  My wife wanted the big one so she can cook everything together.  You can easily cook 3 to 4 eggs with the bacon on the sides.  Its huge.  The only place to store it is in the oven itself.  Moving it around inst that convenient.  I guess that\\'s the price you pay for the size. This is my second cast-iron pan, and I\\'m happy with this product. My other pan is 8\", and I found that for certain recipes, I needed something larger. I\\'ve cooked with it two or three times already. Most of the recipes that I have chosen to make in the smaller pan are meat dishes. I expect that will be my primary use of this pan also. One recipe that I made was a pork tenderloin. I started with the pan on the stove to brown the outside of the meat. Then I can put the cast-iron in the oven without dirtying a separate dish.It\\'s heavy, and I suppose that\\'s a disadvantage, but you know what? It\\'s CAST IRON. One of these days, I\\'ll probably drop it on my dishes, resulting in a sink full of glass, but I just have to be careful. I think that if the pan was any larger it would be unwieldly. I like the second stubby handle on the side. I think that will help me keep a good grip, especially if pouring from the pan.This pan might not fit in some tiny ovens. My oven is a small 4-burner model. I have to angle the pan a little to get it to fit. Great quality, but huge! I used a tape measure when ordering to decide which size to get, and I don\\'t know where I went wrong but this thing is way bigger than I thought it would be, and being cast iron, is soooo heavy! A great product though. I bake a lot of things on stones and I use stainless steel for most stove top things.  But stainless steel kind of sucks for frying, if you crank up the heat, it leaves burned food on the bottom of the pan.  This cast iron allows higher heat and non stick.  The pre-seasoning was good out of the box.  I haven\\'t tried using it for baking but I know they work because my grandmother used to bake cornbread in her pan.  Maybe I\\'ll try it for Johnny cake.  I bought this size because I didn\\'t have room for a 12 inch pan and I didn\\'t want something crazy heavy.  This fits the bill and the price is right.  Also made in USA.EDIT:  I used it for cornbread and it worked better than my corning ware.  So far the 10.25 inch is the best size for my kitchen.  The 12 inch appears to be a great deal too. The only issue with cast iron is the weight.  Since I live in Manhattan and have a galley kitchen I hang my pans on the wall, and you can\\'t do that with cast iron.  Oh well, I pile them up in a corner and in my stove. It\\'s worth it.  Although they come well seasoned, I still season them (when they\\'re hot) for a little while pretty often  - they\\'re really great.  Nothing like an Apple Crisp made in a cast iron skillet on a cold day! Yum!! I haven\\'t had a cast iron pan before this one.  We really love it.  We follow the use and cleaning directions and are super happy with the way it cooks anything we cook in it.  Getting a pre-seasonedpan made it simple. Great product!  I use this skillet every morning for breakfast and for other things also.  Really cooks well, worth the money, buy one. Bought this as an alternative to non-stick fry pans.  No matter how much we pay for them, they seem to last 2-3 years before they get messed up.  Cast iron has been around forever, and believe it or not they work just like non-stick.  Only have to follow the cleaning rules.  Very pleased with this purchase. This is a great frypan.  It is a Lodge.  It is a perfect size for a cheese sandwich or a couple of pieces of bacon.  It goes great with its lid and the lid fits nicely The person I gave this to has an iron deficency. I was told by a doctor that using these skillets helps those who have iron issues. This brand is the best and the value was outstanding. I\\'ve used my pan once now.  It\\'s a monster! It hardly fits on my stove.  Someone was thinking though when they designed it.  It fits perfectly over the center of a large burner when you put it in the corner of your stove.  Any bigger and you would not be able to center it over the heat.  The edges of the corner of your stove basically act like guides.  I cooked bacon on it the first time.  The stuff at the center cooked about 30% faster than on the edges.  This was expected since my burner has a much smaller radius than the bottom of this pan.  You just have to move your food around a little.  I have a glass top electric stove.  I\\'m guessing that would be less of a problem with a gas burner since the flame would spread outwardly and heat the bottom more uniformly than an electric burner.  Contrary to popular belief you can cook with cast iron on a glass top stove.  If this pan didn\\'t break my stove top nothing will.  I am careful though when setting or lifting my cookware.  If you ever did accidentally drop this pan it would break your stove and probably your foot.  I bought mine refurbished.  It looked brand new to me.  They must strip down all the old seasoning to the bare metal and re season it. The seasoning is good for first time use.  A little sticking but gets better I\\'ve noticed on my other Lodge pans with subsequent uses.  Lodge\\'s seasoning process is better than what you can do at home with just one application (in my experience at least).  They do it soon after the cast pan is removed from the mold and is still hot.  They are sprayed with mixture of soy oils and baked for 30 minutes at 700 degrees F.  I think they do this while the pan is still very hot because the iron is more porous at that time and the seasoning takes better.  I scrub my pans with a medium stiffness plastic bristle brush with steaming hot water and this has not harmed the seasoning.  I wish Lodge would polish the cooking surfaces of their pans.  They are a little gritty from the cast.  I have a Le Cruset cast iron pan that I polished down the surface to 400 grit sandpaper and after seasoning it is like glass.  It\\'s as good as teflon without the toxic fumes and about 10% more stick resistant than a gritty cast iron surface upon initial use.  I\\'m thinking about doing this to my Lodge cast iron pans but don\\'t want to risk the season not taking to it as good as the original. If the pores on the surface of the metal get clogged when sanding the seasoning does not take as good I\\'ve been told.  I\\'ve recently converted to cast iron from Analon anodized proffesional series teflon coated non-stick pans.  I did this after finding out how toxic teflon can be.  I can\\'t believe for all my life I was fooled into thinking you can only cook on teflon.  Food does not stick to a well seasoned cast iron pan if the surface has been prepped properly before cooking each time.  They are easy to clean if you know what you are doing.  I run hot water over them while the pans are still hot.  To the point that the water steams.  Steam cleaning takes the grime right off and soap is not necessary.  I quickly dry my pan and rub a light coat of canola oil on it.  I own several pieces of Lodge cast iron cooking vessels and have been very happy with them all.  I have a triple ply stainless steel fry pan by All-Clad that was $150.  Overall, a $15 Lodge cast iron skillet outperforms in all areas other than weight.  I own some Le Cruset enameled pots.  I find food sticks to enameled cast iron surfaces more than a seasoned raw cast iron surface.  I swear that food cooked on cast iron tastes better than food cooked on Teflon coated aluminum.  I think the off gases from the teflon taint the food. After all you are cooking on plastic.  Also this pan would make a very good weapon if an intruder ever broke into your home.  Its got to weigh as much as a medieval battle mace. This pan is on the small side, like for personal use.  But it has the handles on both sides and that is a plus.  It\\'s a great quality cast iron frying pan and it looks good. Love this pan. This is still the same great quality that I have had over  the years with other Lodge items. Still have some that have been with me for many years. At a recent farm auction one sold for $30.00 and you could tell it had been used for many years. Quality always shows. Customer reviews never steer me wrong -- buy with confidence.  Great cost, great quality, made in USA.  I am very critical of my cooking supplies, but this rocks. nothing but a classic cast iron. Great for single person cooking.  The handle is a little short and thin but not worth losing a star over.  I seasoned, even though it comes pre-treated... I\\'d put off getting a cast iron skillet for ages, always wanted one. I\\'d had non stick fry pans up until now, they worked fine, nothing wrong with them. But I\\'d always &#34;hated&#34; them because I\\'d grown up using cast iron - no big deal just a minor nagging want to use this type instead. So I\\'m thrilled, mine works well, sturdy enough, worked out well for me. I have lots of All Clad and Le Creuset and have to be honest, this is the pan that is used most often on my stove. It\\'s great for conducting high heat and getting that perfect sear- I love it. I use if for grilled sandwiches, searing and coking salmon, to sauteeing spinach and mushrooms. Awesome pan! Wow! Do not let the price fool you. This is an extremely heavy duty pan and is fantastic for searing filets before grilling them. Love this skillet! It says it comes pre-seasoned but I would recommend seasoning it yourself anyway. It took that and a few uses for it to become non-stick. Now I use it for just about everything. This is a LONG term report.  I was reviewing my past Amazon purchases and see where I bought this item nearly a decade ago.I\\'ve used this skillet thousands of times in the past 10 years, and it is one of my most valued pieces of cookware.  After so many uses, it has seasoned to perfection and works so great.If you haven\\'t tried cast iron cooking, this would be a great place to start! I generally don\\'t use cast iron pans because they are heavy and bulky. However, there are times and certain dishes that you just need a cast iron pan or pot. I use cast iron when we go camping or when I want to make dishes like baked pancakes, stews, chicken fricasee, beans or corn bread.What recommends this pan is that it is pre-seasoned, nicely balanced, impervious to scratching or marring, won\\'t warp, it heats evenly, stands up well even under the most extreme temperatures and is easy to clean.This pan is reasonably priced, well made, and renders perfect baked apple pancakes and Dutch babies, fried chicken, and amazing cornbread. The side handle/grip makes it easy to handle with a couple of pot holders.My only advice (and I am not sure this is even necessary) is to periodically reseason/cure the cast iron. Cast iron only improves with lots of usage and age. There is no other pan that can take high heat on your gas stove, total abuse from your steel spatula, then go straight into the oven for cornbread, next out to your firepit for a couple hours, and all this only makes it better. Only cast iron actually benefits from frequent use. All it asks from you is a little veggie oil and a dry cupboard. I highly recommend the cover that goes with this pan, too. Wasn\\'t too sure about the description saying it was pre-treated. When it arrived it was pretreated. Great size for an individual and cooking that corn bread! I bought my husband two cast iron skillets for Christmas and they were his favorite gifts.  I recommend buying a press as well. If you have never used cast iron for cooking before or have bought into the &#34;it\\'s too hard to use/take of&#34; horror stories, I strongly suggest you give this skillet a try. Yes, the cleaning and care is different from &#34;normal&#34; pans, but it\\'s not hard once you get used to it. I went with Lodge, because I own two of their Dutch ovens, which I love. The quality of Lodge has never disappointed and the price is right (though I don\\'t know why the lid to this pan costs more than the pan itself). Searing steaks, making gravy or cooking eggs is a breeze and the taste of the food is so much better. Once you\\'ve gotten use to cooking with it (check out Youtube to help speed up the learning curve) you will wish you had bought one sooner. I forgot how much better things are when you cook with cast iron. I think we have used this everyday since we have gotten it. I remember the hamburgers that my mother made on her cast iron skillet: thick, juicy, and browned with a flavorful top and bottom that even a charcoal grill could not match. Sadly I never thought to keep that old skillet after her death, but the memory of those burgers inspired me to order this Lodge Skillet. This beautifully made pan does not disappoint. Not surprisingly the first meal I made with it was hamburgers. And although the slightly rough pan surface made those first burgers a little difficult to turn, they were nevertheless just as delicious as I remembered them. And the pan just keeps getting better with each seasoning and with each use, just as any quality skillet should. Thank you Lodge for creating a wonderful product--and for helping me preserve a fond memory of my Mom. Just learning how to cook at 30, this thing is incredible! So much better than stainless steel!I also own the 15&#34; for batch cooking, and it is equally wonderful (although extremely heavy).I can\\'t recommend Lodge cast iron enough. For those of you who complain about this thing\\'s weight...it\\'s CAST-IRON.What do you expect?!!  For those of you who had the misfortune of receiving a brokenpan....it\\'s CAST-IRON...which makes it solid, but a bit brittle, unlike stainless.And for those of you who love to cook, this pan is a dream-come-true.My wife and I are done with \"non-stick\" pans.  Too many reviews (and solid science to back them up) arefinding that non-stick pans are not safe.  Give cast-iron a chance. Buy this with the Chicago Pizza cookbook and you\\'ll be a rock star!  Boy, does this pan ever rock for pizza!  First thing I made in it when it arrived and well, it just didn\\'t last very long.  Make sure you measure your oven before buying, however.  I\\'m certain that it will not fit in a wall oven unless you have the newer larger sized ones.  Great item to have under your bed too for protection - that 15 inch size makes Repunzel look pretty good swinging it!Anyway, great, great pan, made here in the U.S. A. in Tennessee.  Highly, highly recommend! I am converting all of my stainless steel pots to Cast Iron.  This was one of the first that I purchased.  It holds the heat and cleans up easily.  I wasn\\'t too happy with the Lodge Seasoning.  I was getting a black residue on my towels whenever I washed and wiped it off.  So I removed the lodge seasoning and re seasoned it myself in the oven.  This is a high quality pan.  And I love that I am supporting the US market of manufacturers . Its a nice 8 inch pan.  I know the NEW thing is NON STICK but I think cast on is easy, goes in the oven easy enough and just a little heavy ....that\\'s why I got the little skillet.  I would certainly buy from this seller again and would certainly buy cast-iron skillets..... I\\'ve been using this skillet for about five months now and I love it.  I have an electric stove top and the pan heats uniformly which can be a problem with other pans.  Since it has no plastic parts it can go into the oven, the relatively short handle helps facilitate this.  I was leery of it\\'s weight but it was easy to get used to though I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone with hand or wrist injuries.  The cleanup is not quite comparable to nonstick pans but much easier than conventional pans.  I shopped around the net to find the best price and with Amazon\\'s free shipping and low price I couldn\\'t find it any cheaper.  Now I want the lid! I love my new cast iron skillet.  I had one years ago, but discarded it because it was rusty.  I use salt (instead of soap and water) to clean this one.  It doesn\\'t rust and clean-up is a breeze.  At first, I did have to season it with oil a few times.  This heats up extremely hot and really holds the heat.  I use it often both on the stove and in the oven. I had spent a lot more money on pans which failed to heat as well as my Lodge porcelain cast iron dutch oven. When my Calphalon started to chip I decided to go &#34;old school&#34; and pick up a Lodge cast iron skillet. It took a few tries to season it but I finally have it to the point where I can make most foods and it is just as non-stick as the Calphalon. The nice thing is that the more you use it, the more seasoned it becomes and the easier it is to cook in. Every time I clean it (no soap!), I dry it and give it a quick once over with olive oil so it\\'s good to go the next time. Cast iron isn\\'t the easiest to care for, but it sure is durable.  Some things stick more than others, but I have found that using enough oil seems to make it easier. This is a great cast iron skillet. Follow the seasoning and cleaning directions and you\\'ll have a great pan that\\'s virtually stick free for a long long time! I have been looking for a nice cast-iron pan for a while and couldn\\'t decide between an expensive Le Crueset enameled cast-iron or just a standard cast-iron pan. I eventually decided on this and it works great.  I\\'m careful to clean it properly without using soap and if you clean it warm isn\\'t too hard.  Eventually I hope to build up a great seasoning.  I think this pan will last forever. While I didn\\'t buy this for myself, I have owned other Lodge pans, and they\\'re fanfrasmic. You know they are, that\\'s why you\\'re here. You can\\'t find any vintage cast iron and you want American made. I get it. It\\'s good stuff. We are children of the teflon age. We use teflon any time we need something non-stick, and stainless otherwise. Using this cast-iron skillet has been a real treat. Not for every situation, but it makes great roasted chicken, potatoes, and excellent country breakfasts. Give it a shot! I purchased this preseasoned Lodge 8-inch skillet as a complement to my 10-inch, which is a monster, for use on an induction cooktop. All I can say: perfection. Good ol\\' American quality, the way it used to be. The price is a steal for a skillet this well made that will last a lifetime.The size of this particular skillet fits perfectly within the heating ring of a typical induction cooktop, for which cast iron is notably suited. Empty a full-size can of soup into this, stick it on that 1,800-watt burner, and you\\'re ready to go in under three minutes. Could eat out of the skillet if you wanted to. Nothing is simpler.Buy this. You won\\'t regret it. I should have known going in that this was going to be tough to clean, so that\\'s my only complaint.  Compared to other skillets I\\'ve owned, this one\\'s great!  My fiance had seasoned the skillet with Crisco even though it\\'s pre-seasoned already.  We mostly use it to cook up greasy breakfast foods and steaks.  Be sure to clean it right when you\\'re done while it\\'s still warm, otherwise you\\'ll have to clean it out and re-season.  Highly recommended skillet. I love cooking in my iron skillet, it gives a much better flavor to food. I also love doing blackened chicken/salmon/fajitas.It\\'s a great size for a medium sized family. The price was nice, how ever the pre-seasoning lifted in the center of pan first time I used it. I have and have used many other iron pans, so I do know how to use and care for. I am now oil and baking to season. Have all quality stainless pans with NO non-stick anything because I don\\'t want any chemical coating leaching into the food I cook.  This is my first cast iron pan.  Takes some getting used to just brushing it out with some warm water for cleaning(NO soap, it ruins the seasoning, takes away the non-stick properties of cast and promotes rust).  Used to be a big microwave person until I discovered waterless cookware. And now use the cast iron for searing meats too!  Great flavorizer pan! The more it gets used, the better the \"nonstick\" properties become. This review probably won\\'t add to the points already raised in previous reviews.  The idea is great.  However, the maintenance may not be worthwhile for us. We live such busy lives that we were hoping that cast-iron simply meant better and more evenly cooked or prepared foods.The unit we got had a very rough surface, with pits and spots standing tall enough from the surface, which meant we probably needed to season the surface multiple times until we got it a nice, smooth surface, according to the other reviews.  Plus, the cleaning: I have guests coming through my place who will be adamant of washing this pan the wrong way.  No point having this around of relatives have a tendency to do this.Plus, the edge seems quite high when compared to the size of the bottom.If my life settles down, I may try picking this up again.  For now, I recently picked up the 12-inch Lodget cast-iron skillet.  If it stands the test of time (and relatives), maybe I\\'ll pick up the 8-inch one and revise my rating. I love cooking with this thing! Fried eggs, bacon, stir-fry, steak, homemade breads and rolls, just to name a few. I have been really paranoid about maintaining the seasoning and it is starting to really pay off. Lightly oil the pan and I can get eggs that leave almost no trace in the pan. I cannot really speak for the \"pre-seasoned\" surface, as I seasoned it myself right after I bought it. Have been seasoning it periodically (without removing the existing surface) and it seems to be holding up really well. I don\\'t think cast iron is for everyone, but if you want a more natural alternative to non-stick pans, I think it is worth the extra maintenance work. I also love that I can go from range to oven without worrying about the pan. It\\'s a great skillet, I use it almost daily now. I would re-season it before use... it was seasoned, but things still stuck to it. now they don\\'t. SO useful. Perfect size, perfect weight. Cast iron pans are great tools for my kitchen and Lodge makes a great one. You can\\'t go wrong. This skillet is the real deal and comes and the most perfect price!!  How can you go wrong?!  It\\'s heavy but they\\'re suppose to be! This is a heavy, thick, HUGE cast iron skillet.  Perfect for making a large meal and easy to take care of. LOVE IT. Try to find specific measurements on this listing and you\\'ll be disappointed. The 9 inch description on this skillet refers to the top edge, not the base of the skillet.I was disappointed in the surface of this pan. It is very rough. I\\'m looking for a cast iron skillet like my grandma\\'s, which is smooth on the inside and most of the outside too, making it easy to clean.I don\\'t know how this rough pan cooks and cleans up, though. I sent mine back after I received it. I bought this and then my son started using it a lot.  He didn\\'t know how to maintain it so I told him how to maintain it, seasoning it occasionally.  I was afraid it had suffered too much but it\\'s fine.  It has stood up well to, hmm, let\\'s say inconsistent maintenance.  It\\'s very good quality for the price.  I wanted cast iron and I got exactly what I hoped for. This is the perfect skillet to make manicotti creapes. A must have item for the Italian cook. Mix 1 1/4 cups of water with 4 large eggs. Add 1 1/4 cup all purpose flour until smooth. Use 1/8 cup aka 1 oz scoop in a hot 6.5\" skillet, preheated with cooking spray, and cook until dry. Repeat for manicotti that\\'s real & authentic. Not that disgusting \"Tube O Pasta\" from the box. I\\'ve always heard fantastic things about cast iron pans, but I\\'d never owned one. After hearing so many good things from Alton Brown, I finally got one. Cast iron does indeed live up to the hype. It retains heat very well, cooks evenly, and cleanup is not the nightmare people often depict.I\\'ve been extremely happy with Lodge\\'s 12-inch cast iron skillet. It\\'s ready to use out of the box, is well made, and gets better the more you use it. If you don\\'t have one and are looking to round out your kitchen, you can\\'t go wrong with this well-made product. Got this pan to replace a 12\" cast iron pan that went missing (still don\\'t know where it went..lost it somehow during two apartment moves)This 8\" size is perfect for preparing a small to medium 1-2 person meal. I\\'ve used it to make spanish omelets / frittatas, and it cooks with that \"homey\" feel.Love this pan, and I\\'m sure it will serve me for the rest of our lifetime and perhaps another generation. (If I don\\'t lose this one too) Can\\'t believe cast iron pans were old school and ugly.Yes stainless is shiny and nice looking, but for great results, steady even heat and versitility,I love this pan.Corn bread in this sucker...BAM! I purchased a 10.5 inch recently and then just got the 8 inch pre-seasoned cast-iron skillet. So far I haven\\'t had much really stick to these skillets. I\\'ve used them primarily to sear meats, oven roast, and then make gravy. They are both fantastic and really help to bring out the flavor of the meats.And you really can\\'t go wrong....$15 bucks for the 10 inch and/or $10 bucks for the 8 inch. Just go for it....you won\\'t be sorry!I\\'ve tried searing in my non-stick teflon pans but it was just not the same. For some reason the cast-iron got hotter and gave me a much better sear....and much better flavor! I even made gravy in the skillet after and the clean up was about as easy as a teflon pan....no sticking on the cast-iron!I don\\'t think I will need to purchase the &#34;lodge scraper&#34; or even the &#34;Lodge silicon handle&#34;. I have a handy little nylon brush should I need it (haven\\'t needed it) for clean up. And I use kitchen tea towels to grab the hot handles from the stove or oven. No need to spend more than I have to on extras.Yeah, a non-stick pan/skillet has it\\'s place - it\\'s had a place in my kitchen all my life. I just wish I had decided many years earlier to also have a nice relatively inexpensive cast iron skillet in my kitchen too. It makes a world of difference and it won\\'t break the bank either! I would recommend Lodge cast iron wear to anyone.  I have purchased many of their cook wear and have been nothing but pleased.... This \"pre-seasoned\" skillet comes ready to use, although, as the directions state, you\\'ll need to season it from time to time, especially if you want to cook with only a little oil or if food starts to stick. Because I can\\'t stand the idea of just wiping clean instead of using dishwasher soap, I do wash it, and I still don\\'t need to season it every time.If you are unfamiliar with cast iron, you should know that it is indeed heavy. The main handle on this skillet is a little short and narrow; fortunately, it comes with a gripping handle on the other side for two-handed lifting. You also need to dry cast iron immediately to avoid rust. But you cannot beat cast iron for an even, radiating heat.This particular cast iron pan (12-inch skillet) is deep enough for pan frying, but it works equally well for saut&eacute;eing and even griddle cooking.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann I started craving the taste of child hood cast iron prepared meals. I do feel like I am pumping iron but I am sure I will get better strength. I am not unhappy about my purchase though. Someone on a review I had read said to use coconut oil rubbed on these cast iron products and put in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour to keep the treated. They are treated when they come in but she said they are not treated enough. So, I will do this probably once or twice a week. I love them because they use less oil and not sticky if treated. The food has better flavor. Why did I stop usiing them? Maybe for more attractive pots and pans. Well, I\\'m back! Best price I had seen on sites. This was my first cast iron purchase and after 3 months of use, it is my favorite and most versatile item in the kitchen!  To the folks who had rust issues, I think they must have washed the item with harsh soap and water.  However, I wipe it clean after each use with a paper towel, and only wash with very mild/small amount of soap (no scrubbing!) when it REALLY needs to be washed...and I have not had any rust issues!  Remember, it is cast iron, so you want that little bit of grease to stay on the pan and keep reheating it with each use to create the \"seasoning\" on it.  So don\\'t wash it off--it will just make it harder to use!  It is completely nonstick for all types of cooking...Indian, Mexican, Italian, grilling, etc.  I love this pan & no worries of chemical coatings leaching into food! The Lodge is flat handle to handle so a spatter screen completely covers it. I have some cast iron that doesn\\'t and they are not  used nearly as because of this feature. Also check out the chain mail cleaner also available at Amazon. It makes cleanup a breeze. It doesn\\'t mar the cast iron and it does not clog. I looked around a bit before I chose this brand of pan.  There\\'s a big difference in price and quality; I did some research as I\\'ve never bought cast iron cookware.  I found out that Lodge is a very good brand, right up there with the best.  Mine came already seasoned, so I was happy about that.  I went ahead and did a little pre-seasoning anyway.  If you follow the instructions, you\\'ll get a pan that\\'s almost non-stick, retains heat like no other type of pan and will probably last longer than you\\'ll live!  I found it\\'s one of the best ways to cook: steaks, chops, hamburgers, bacon, vegetables, etc..  It will even make hot sandwiches too.  I recommend getting some type of &#34;press&#34; to go with it to help sear your meats, etc.  I plan on buying more pots and pans, even though I have a top of the line stainless &#34;All Clad&#34; set.  It\\'s a whole different experience in cooking!  Oh, you can even bake with it!! I just got this pan a few days ago, after reading the reviews, which are all true,  and I love it! I too bought nonstick pans because I hated the clean up and didn\\'t like things to stick. This pan is very easy to clean and food doesn\\'t stick to it at all, as long as you take care of it properly. I got so tired of buying nonstick pans because even though they have those long warranties, they alway seem to eventually stick, and then be thrown away.. I hate to just keep spending money over and over for new cookware. Now I won\\'t have to. I just made breakfast in this pan, and made the best bacon gravy ever! I never thought a pan could make things taste better until I cooked in this and I swear, you can taste the difference- things have a more intense flavor.  If I want to use metal utensils no worries.. this pan is a little bigger than I thought as well.. There are no cons about this pan that I can honestly think about, other than it is heavier than your average skillet, but not too bad. Buy you a couple of pans and get free shipping- now that\\'s a win-win situation! I grill over charcoal several times a week.  I use this pan to melt butter that I brush over corn on the cob that I am roasting.  The Lodge quality is great and shipping was fast. pan was good on the the barbeque!!!! And it was great on the stove. but it got a small crack in the handle. I\\'ve had this pan for years. I use it mostly for eggs and beef dishes like beef stroganoff. After reading some of the reviews, I noticed that people have mentioned food sticking. I have found that if the pan is heated up enough before putting anything in it, the food won\\'t stick. I have done this with eggs as well as steaks. I also use soap and hot water with a scrub brush on it, but after I rinse it, I use a paper towel to dry it off, then rub it down with canola oil and bake it on 450 degrees for about 45 minutes. I do this with all my cast iron cookware. It keeps it in great shape.If you found this review helpful, please click yes. Thanks! Very heavy but its great American made...yay! And well made. Great little pan. The handle could be about 2 or 3 \" longer for safety and sensibility but I am very pleased. Size is perfect for one grilled sandwich or a couple eggs and its cute to boot!Oh, this does need further seasoning. My food stuck but I still love it.Some one had suggested getting several for fajitas. i\\'m seriously thinking about it.It\\'s so cute I decided to hang it on my kitchen wall by the stove. Charming. This skillet is the perfect size: big enough to cook two \"kissing\" over-medium eggs at the same time (or a generous omelette), yet small enough to fit on one of the small back burners I seldom use except to boil water. I can leave this skillet sitting on my stove, opposite my Lodge double grill/griddle, and cook up a bodacious amount of food without having to shuffle things around so much.The 8\" was a little too small to cook eggs for two people...so I gave it to my son. The 9\" is absolutely perfect for me. I like to clean/maintain my cast iron by swiping it out with a paper towel after cooking, while it\\'s still warm, and then just leave it in place on the stove without having to lift it over to the sink--except on those rare occasions that I burn something onto it and need to scrub it off under water. I\\'ve cooked in cast iron this way for 35 years and haven\\'t gotten sick from it yet! I only use cast iron but my biggest pan was only  9 in.  and it just wasn\\'t big enough.  I bought this and when it arrived I thought, geez this is HUGE and heavy but it has become my &#34;go to&#34; pan.  Cast iron is the only way to cook. 1. American made. 2. American made. 3. American made. 4 Great American made product. I wouldn\\'t buy any other brand. I have used a Lodge skillet for many years, mostly for smoking fish. A few (15 grams) wood chips are placed in the empty skillet; an Aluminum foil layer is put down not touching the bottom of the skillet, and with a hole (2cm x 2cm say) in the middle. A grill is placed on top of the skillet, 500 gr or ~1-1.5 lbs fish on the grill, and a cover put that contains most of the smoke and heat. This then is placed (outside or under a hood) on an electric element set to full heat (for a 1.2 kW element) -- some smoke is produced (surprise surprise!). 50 minutes later, the electricity is turned off, and the system is allowed to cool for ~30 minutes.  (Sally Schneider, The Art of Low-Calorie Cooking -- a wonderful book, but only low-calorie if one watches one\\'s step!)The fish can be brined or just basted with some salt (1 t) , soy (2 T), and sugar (1 T) beforehand.Take care not to burn yourself or start a fire in the process.I bought a new skillet because I broke the old one (long story, not a weakness in the manufacture). Since it is not noted elsewhere, the dimensions given are at the _top_ of the edge of the skillets. As an example, the 9\" skillet has a bottom cooking surface which is 7 1/2\" in diameter. I have tons of these pans in a variety of sizes. I love and use cast iron as much as possible. If you have never made a from scratch pineapple upside down cake in one of these you don\\'t know what you are missing. Home fries, a grilled cheese, I could go on and on. Some things just cook better in cast iron. The right pan for the job is important when learning to cook. There are things that don\\'t work well also, scrambled eggs not so much. But every cook should have at least 1 of these pans and if you will only have one, the 12&#34; skillet is probably your best all around pan. I love this thing.  But don\\'t leave any part of of it wet after you wash it.  It will rust pretty quick.  Cheers... I don\\'t use it often but it is great for baking in the oven and cooking on my stove top.  Just the right size for me. My lovely bride did some reading on preparing steak in a cast iron skillet.  I come home one day and this new purchase is on the stove and she has a couple of beautiful filets laid out.  Seared in the skillet, finished in the oven. Perfection.  Now, instead of standing outside in all manner of weather grilling a steak while drinking a beer, I just drink the beer.  Best. Wife. Ever. I bought this and am pleased with it, but I laughed when I opened the box. It is quite small. The 6 1/2 measurement is the external width, the bottom of the frying pan is closer to 5 or 5 1/2 inches. So you can make it burger, but it\\'s tight. I still like it for the price and the unusual size and recommend it when purchased knowing what you\\'re getting. The Lodge cast iron skillet is my favorite cooking appliance.  I previously used it primarily for steaks and vegetables, but I recently cooked the best salmon and breaded chicken recipes.  This one is my favorite size, but if you frequently cook for two or if you cook large bone-in ribeyes where the bone sticks out beyond the edges of the steak, you may want to get the larger size.  I have the 10-1/4, 13-1/4, and the square grill pan.  The grill pan makes cooking healthier but I like it the least because cleaning is a pain. I\\'ve used a few different sizes (and own two of these myself). Here\\'s my size guide:15&#34;: Cooking protein for 4-6 people.12&#34;: Cooking protein for 2-3 people.10.25&#34;: Cooking protein for 1-2 people.If you\\'re buying your first skillet, I definitely recommend the 12&#34;. The other sizes certainly have uses as well, but if know you need a different size from the above, you probably have a good reason :)Always cook with some sort of fat in the pan: oil, butter, lard, etc. To clean, scrub with kosher salt (it\\'s cheap!), preferably while the pan is still warm/hot, and dry immediately. This giant piece of iron weighs more than you could imagine...It is worth more in scrap metal than what I paid for it.I shouldn\\'t have bought this giant...I\\'d have been better served buying one size less. This monster is for restaurants and the military.It does what I want, but, it takes an hour to heat the bastard..Too big for me. Worth every cents. Really good products. Indeed heavy and needs careful handling but overall it\\'s a great product. There are a lot of wonderful reviews on this product so you should read them. What I willsay is that if you are NOT into taking extra care of a pan you should pass by the ironskillet. Pre- seasoned or not.You definitely have to scrape out the leftovers, wipe it down, sometimes wipe it again, andthen season it again with oil. A bit more labor intensive than stainless or non-stick.The pan is almost 8 pounds and could be used as a lethal weapon against intruders. Itappears to be a well built pan without any sharp edges and has a useful second handlewhich will be hot to the touch.In retrospect after having used this pan for over a year I would have to say I\\'d go witha very good stainless steel pan and forgo using the heavy metal skillet unless needed asa backup or for home defense.Happy cooking to all and to all a good night... What more can be said about Lodge cast iron?I just made a deep dish skillet pizza. Turned out great!!!!Great size I own 7 pc of Lodge. Food just tastes better.Good size for over a camp fire.Amazon shipping was Superman Fast !!!!!!!!! I haven\\'t found any real application for a pan this small, but it is cute. I had planned on using it to fry an egg for my \\'egg McMuffin sandwiches, and it\\'s OK, but a little small. I prefer the 5 inch instead. I do like Lodge cast iron cooking equipment. At my wedding in the 70\\'s I was given a gift from a woman that was 75.  She gave me two cast iron pans that was her mothers. Talk about seasoned!!! I loved those pans more than my husband! lol.  That is just a few years of last-ability!  About 6-7 years later I had a house fire.  I lost basically everything but there was that pan. I think the other pan \\'walked away\\'. I am still using that pan. Not only did it survive a house fire that melted even glass, it is still in fine condition!!!So, I bought this pan to replace its bother that was lost.  I can\\'t beat a pant hat has been conditioned for over 100 years but its not bad. I did condition the pan anyway. It does have a tough act to follow after all. Every time I use it I put it on the stove, rub it with oil and let it heat for a little bit and it is one more day to being conditioned like the others.  Its still a very good pan. One day someone will be telling a history about it too. :-)As MUST HAVE for a cast iron pan...Lodge HHMT Max Temp Handle Mitt, BlackHandle mits! Love this skillet.  Huge and heavvvvy.  Definitely need that helping handle on the other side of the pan.  I am thinking about getting another size if it has that handle.  Kinda heavy for someone 70 and weaker than a field mouse. This thing is beefy, and needs oil on first few cooks for sure. Should be fun cooking with this horse.  No reason to pay more for french cast iron, this one will work just as well. This is the perfect size skillet for a single person or \\'empty nesters\\'!  It is big enough to handle a couple sausage patties or a few sausage links, scrambled eggs, or a single large hamburger.  I can see one of those pre-made store-bought bacon wrapped filet mignons frying up in it too!  It will also handle a small batch of cornbread or can be used to make a personal size pizza.  The possibilities are endless with this skillet, use it for a grilled cheese sandwich, it will work for that too!  Since it\\'s cast iron it works on induction cooktops like the NuWave induction cooktops.  It is small enough for those little jobs but big enough that it will be a valuable and useful skillet in your kitchen or camp site!!! Nice little skillet.  It comes pre-seasoned.  To clean, you just scrub it with a brush, and put oil in it.  I feel if you follow the directions on care, it should last a long time.Handle really gets hot and makes it difficult to transfer it to the sink or move while using it.  So decided to give it 4 stars instead of 5.I use it a fair amount, and am quite happy with my purchase. I have the lodge Cast Iron Skillets at 6\", 8\", 10\", 12\", and 15\".  All of these are fantastic EXCEPT the 15\" skillet which is not flat.  The center of the pan buldges upwards like a hill and the oil trickles down to the sides of the pan.  I have read that other reviewers have the same issue, but only with the 15\".  It makes cooking an omelette quite the challenge. If these are pre-seasoned, it must be a short season. After seasoning these myself, they operate far superior than when I first got them...them as in the two pans I purchased...this one and the 10-1/4&#34; skillet. 5-stars if they would have actually been fully seasoned. These things should have had a shine to them when opening them and perhaps wrapped in wax paper...not the case though. For under $20 and free shipping, this can\\'t be beat.  Though it comes pre-seasoned, I still coat it (the entire pan, inside and out and the handle, too) thinly with regular vegetable oil and bake it in a 450-degree oven for an hour.  I then let the pan cool completely and repeat the process one more time.  It is true that you need good kitchen ventilation to do this though not over-coating with oil cuts down on the greasy smoke considerably.The pan now looks amazingly shiny and nothing sticks to it. Omlettes, potato pancakes, sauteing vegetables, roasting a whole chicken, etc. Everything comes out great and above all, no worries about non-stick chemicals, etc.I do repeat the seasoning process every so often purely for asthetic reasons because I like my entire pan to be equally black! I prefer to cook with an open flame and the Cast Iron pans distribute the heat evenly and help with the cooking.  What I really like about cast iron is how well things fry up and brown.  The heat is distributed so well and things look and taste great after cooking in these pans and pots.  I use oil to keep the pan working well so if you are a non-oil cooker you might not like that aspect.I\\'ve been using Cast Iron to cook with most of my life, born and raised using Cast Iron and I have to say it\\'s really a great way to cook.  You need to understand it\\'s not Teflon, things respond differently but once you learn how it responds, it\\'s wonderful.  With time my pans are nice and dark and develop their own nearly non-stick surface.  Just a light cleaning after use and they are ready to go again.  The lids are interchangeable between the cook top pans (like this one), the cook tope ovens and the camp pans that have legs for use with Charcoal.  The similar sizing also helps with storing things since you can stack them nicely in your pantry.Things I prefer to cook in Cast Iron are meats and anything oily.  Fried items such as pancakes, French toast and eggs also work extremely well.  I do NOT like to cook things that need to be boiled such as rice or spaghetti in Cast Iron, use other pots for that.If you can find one of these at a garage sale or thrift shop, grab it up.  These can\\'t really go bad and will last a lifetime.  Clean it, season it and it\\'ll last you forever too.In order of how often I use my Cast Iron, I\\'ll list types, sizes and most common usesLodge 5-quart Dutch Oven (loop handles or wire bale) same size as 10\" camp oven; used for cooking meats and family sized casserolesLodge 10-inch Skillet; used for frying up breakfast, grilled cheese and much moreLodge 7-quart Dutch Oven; same size as 12\"camp oven; used for larger family mealsLodge 12-inch Skillet; used for frying larger meals and when camping or groups at homeLodge 8-quart Camp Dutch oven (legs); used for outdoor charcoal camp mealsThere are special Cast Iron cookbooks that have unique ways to use these pans and ovens too, give one of those a try and you\\'ll find many new and tasty things you never thought about cooking in a pan before!5 stars, you can\\'t go wrong with a cast iron pan.  It\\'s not for everything but it works well for certain types of cooking. Cast iron is excelent for general purpose cooking, and Lodge Logic makes good stuff. Plus, the fact that it comes seasoned means it\\'s ready to use straight out of the box.Cast iron is naturally non-stick, and so minimizes the additional chemicals that your food comes in contact with. Plus, the lack of an artificial nonstick coating means you can use a metal spatula or fork to stir and not worry about it reacting with the surface of the pan.It\\'s not perfect for every situation, though. Searing and other fast-heat techniques require a thinner metal, so I still have a copper-bottomed pan around just for that. But It\\'s in a dark corner of the kitchen, and the Lodge Logic is right on the stovetop.The only thing that holds it back from a perfect score is that, in my experience, the pre-seasoning is a bit shoddy. I lost the origional seasoning just a couple of weeks after getting the pan. Noticed the distinct metal-taste in whatever I cooked. But, of course, a couple quick coats of crisco, a couple trips through a hot oven, and it was back up to 100%.Every cook should have a good set of cast iron. Even, gentile heat is perfect for most every cooking situation. And it can be used as a very handy weapon in case of intruders or bears. I bought this for my daughter as a gift.  She thought it might be too large and was also worried that she didn\\'t have a big enough burner to heat it, so was going to trade it with me for my 12&#34; iron skillet...until her son and husband saw it.They talked her into keeping it.  I assured her that a good iron skillet will heat evenly on any source of heat.  Now she has used it several times and loves it.American made, so very good quality. This skillet does not represent progress. It is far, far inferior to the better cast iron skillets of the 1930\\'s. I have a Griswold cast iron skillet from that period and it is 1/2 the weight of this Lodge skillet. The Griswold heats up much more quickly and cooks much better. This Lodge skillet is just too heavy. Its awkward to have to muscle this Lodge around the kitchen. Its painful to have to watch my smaller mother struggle with it. Simply put I would not recommend this skillet for most women its just too heavy, and could be dangerous if dropped.Still having said that this skillet is affordable, and the pre-seasoned coating is a plus. The skillet doesnt cook that well out of the box though, it takes quite a bit of cooking before it improves. So dont give up on it if you dont like the results the first time you use it.The bottom line is if you want a one handed skillet dont buy this. If you dont mind lugging this heavy thing around with two hands it cooks acceptably well.I\\'m not sure what modern cast iron ware there is out there today which doesnt weigh a ton but this isnt it. I do know the Griswold stuff from the past is lighter and cooks better than this however. I really like this size.  I have the 8 inch and this size is much better.  I cook everything from vegetables, eggs and meat.  I seasoned it in the oven over 5 times with flax seed oil. I have no problems with the food sticking.  Cleans up great.  I also bought the lid to go with it, which makes for each quicker cooking time. The best cast iron skillet out there in my opinion. This company has been doing it right for a long time. Should last a lifetime. It cooks evenly, cleans with no worries about scratching and can be used for self defense, lol. When I was picking out the basics for my kitchen, I never thought I needed a cast iron skillet.  They weren\\'t used much in either my home or my husband\\'s home growing up.  As I got more into cooking and amassed a small army of cookbooks, I realized that every single one of my cookbooks assumed that I had a cast iron skillet for at least one recipe.  When Alton Brown used a cast iron skillet to make delicious looking burgers and tenderloin I noticed he used a \"Lodge\" brand skillet - so imagine my surprise (and delight) to find out how incredibly affordable a pre-seasoned skillet was!Yes, the care instructions make it a little more difficult to wash - but it\\'s not tedious and there is a lot of information on the web with tips to make the process easier.  I cook on an electric coil stove (no gas hook up) and cooking with the skillet has been a joy - once preheated, the heat is conducted evenly.  Certain foods (like fried eggs) are much easier when cooked on the skillet than in my Calphalon pans.While I\\'m not ready to ditch all my pots for cast iron, I am very happy that I did decide to add this to my collection. Steaks, bone-in chicken breasts, peppers- there are so many foods I love preparing in a cast iron skillet.  Its heat retention allows you to create a golden crust on chicken like you\\'ve only dreamed of until now.  How do they get those black grill marks on vegetables without using a grill? Cast iron.  A 12&#34; pan is large enough to cook two chicken breasts at once, or two small steaks.  The pan is very heavy and does require special cleaning (brush out residue, wipe clean and apply oil) .  I have used this for over a year and the original seasoning is still in good shape. Many years since I have used CI cookware. I purchased the 5 pc set and this 13.5 Skillet.and also bought another 13.5 for our son. We both are crazy about the size and excellent job it has done on our meals. Of course for me it is a tad heavy..but if full my Hubby helps me. I had Grandmothers Lodge skillets have no idea how old ( way over 70+ years).. and \\'loaned\\' them to a couple stranded hunters in the Forest..with the promise they would bring them back..they NEVER did. The age and sentimental value was priceless.So this last Christmas I started to  buy New Lodge for me...and our youngest son. The 13.5 Cooks everything perfect. Thank you Amazon & Lodge. These are fantastic, I actually learned about Lodge Cast Iron in Mexico. Went to spend a week many years ago in Mexico at the house of the family of a gal I was dating. Her mom had some Lodge, a big deep like 5 qt. or something and a couple of frying pans that her mother got as a wedding gift.On that trip I actually used one of the fry pans to do a grilled cheese and do some eggs I think. I remember that I was impressed and called them Henry Cabot pans so I would remember after the statesman, Lodge.That was 30 plus years ago, I am not sure I remember the gals name  I dated. But  when I saw this Gold Box Deal I had only a few minutes so I didn\\'t read much and ordered it, and after I did I thought,  I thought I hope this is the same quality, and hoping it wasn\\'t made in China. When I opened the box , which had big yellow tags HEAVY USE CARE, I pushed away the plastic air filled bags and attached to the handle was  an American Flag Tag , on the other side was a smaller flag WITH BOLD TYPE LETTERS, Made in the USA. I am approaching 70 now, and can remember when those three words appeared everywhere. I am planning on getting a smaller pan  soon.Maybe we can do something like in Finland, who has the best schools in the world these days, teachers must have a masters and teaching credentials,many teachers have been in business retired early and teach. I think they said even the head of Nokia teaches, and it is all neighborhood schools if the kids don\\'t move they go all the way through school with the same kids.And the kids walk to school because it is only a few blocks away. And I am going to make a note on the will to make sure themom who makes  sure my place is clean gets the Lodge Pans. This stuff will last at least 120 years which is how long Lodge has made these things in Tennessee.I am not now or ever been employed or a represented either Lodge Mfg. or Amazon. Gotta go have a nice New York State wants to meet &#34; the  skillet&#34;. I bought Lodge made in the USA Tenn. in fact USA Iron  Not china iron)). I have since bought another skillet and now the dutch oven is next on my list. Once you learn how to cook with cast Iron all other cookware falls short of the bennies it offers. From heating up items, to full chicken dinners its the best. Holds heat a long time after cooking, gives even temp throughout pan. I just made chicken breasts that come out perfect eveytime. I simply place breasts in skillet season then place foil over it and put it in oven @350 45 min take off foil 20 min before done to crisp up skin. Other skillet I cut potatoes, onion, 1 pepper, little olive oil, season throw in oven for 45- 60 min and the pan browns and cooks a perfect dinner. Easy to clean I dont use anything else, even serve from skillet.Reheat pizza is the best!! Heat pan up full flame 10 min. Shut off heat under pan place pizza slice in skillet and cover and in 10 min you have slighly browned crust and just a perfect reheated slice, well worth the wait taste better then fresh to me. Since it hold heat so long will heat pizza brown but not burn it. I can go on and on of its used. If you use butter or spray before you cook even eggs dont stick. Once you learn how to get the pan to right temp nothing will stick. Frying is the best, burgers in the pan place lid and it will brown as they cook as well.Its all in learning how to heat and use pan since it holds the heat long, but once you master it nothing cooks food and can crisp food like this. Veggies are the best. Heat pan up good throw in veggies and cup of water cover the heat will steam them perfect then throw in butter as water evaporates butter covers veggies, makes them perfect.I also read that cooking in cast iron will supply natually iron into your diet, is it true ? I dont know. But for the cost buy 1 and try it experiment with it. To me it does not get any better.Plus they will outlive you if you season and take care of them and you can hand them to your off spring like Grandma did. Old fashion is still the best way to cook. It\\'s certainly no Wagner Ware, but this skillet (using medium-high heat or lower) is a wonderful thing, not to mention priced very competitively. I didn\\'t mind the pre-seasoned surface on this particular pan. Overall, very impressed with everything this pan can handle. Breakfast, eggs, baked dinners, just about anything you can throw at it--and it cleans out nicely.Verdict: For the price, I would highly recommend it! When it comes to frying or searing a heavy cast iron pan is the best for the job at hand.  We own several very expensive pans that boast even heat distribution and heat retention.  Some of these cost more than a hundred dollars.  None of them perform as well as this very inexpensive cast iron pan for stove top frying or searing.  All that being said the only negative is the weight.  These pans are heavy and the handles get hot.  If you are willing to use two hands to lift the pan and use mittens then this is the pan for you. Perfect size, perfect price.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys cooking. As a Southern cook, cast iron is essential in my kitchen. This pan will serve you well. It cooks on high heat, in both the oven and on the stove top. Great for baking cornbread or searing steaks on high heat.Cast iron is not nonstick (don\\'t know where that came from). But a seasoned pan is virtually nonstick if it is maintained; i.e., kept seasoned. When cooking, you want to first heat your pan and then add oil or butter after the pan is hot.Never use soap on it; that is one secret to keep it from rusting. Only wash it out with water and leave the oil/fats intact. Dry it immediately with paper towels after use; then put it on a burner on low heat and let it sit for about 3-5 minutes, then turn off the heat. This gets any residual moisture out of the pan. Let it sit on the burner until the burner and pan are cold, then put the pan away. From time to time, season per directions.If you have never seasoned a cast iron pan, rub it lightly with oil, and place it in an oven at about 350F for about one hour. Remove it from your oven and let it cool on your stove top. Wipe away the excess oil with paper towels and store the pan for its next use.If you take care of it, this pan will last your lifetime. I\\'m really beginning to use this Lodge 8-inch skillet regularly and like it a lot. So far, just using it for bacon, eggs, and home fries for breakfast. Well, it does hamburgers to perfection (one at a time - this is not ha huge pan) too. But I\\'m sure, since this is cast iron it would stand being placed in the hottest oven for some recipes. There is a good eight inch cover available for this, too. Fits perfectly. You, too, may learn to love cast iron cooking! Cleanup no problem. Just fill the pan with hot water after it cools a little after you finish cooking. Let it soak a while and then scrub it with a teflon pad, or a brush, or use a scraper (Lodge sells those), and all the residue comes off. Place some cooking oil in it for the next time after drying it. It\\'s so retro it\\'s fun! I purchased two of these skillets to use for breakfast skillets for my wife and I and we love them.They are your standard Lodge Logic skillets but in a smaller size, which is the perfect size for breakfast.We make them, spread the cheese on them and pop them into the toaster oven to melt the cheese.  Then we can serve it directly at the table, one skillet for each of one and the heat from the iron keeps the food hot while you eat.We also have larger skillets that we could use and have people serve themselves from it, but the individual skillets make a much better impression.We\\'ll be buying more so that when we have guests, each person still has one.The only complaint that I have with it, which I have about all Lodge Logic skillets, is that the surface is fairly rough, unlike some older (no longer in production) skillets.  This roughness allows for food to stick on the skillet more than on those other types of skillets.  I\\'m hoping that, with years of use, the surface will get smoother. I have given my son all of my older cast iron ware and just bought a 10 inch Lodge pan with helper handle.  I received it today and this evening made beef and snowpeas in it that were so pretty I shared a photo on Facebook.  Nothing else would have been so easy to cook in and so easy to clean.  This pan will stay on top of stove for regular use.  Cleaning is a snap and results of cooking are standout.  Thanks to the Lodge Family for continuing to make this product in America and for being a green company. Nicely pre-seasoned--sure, it will improve as you use it more, but it\\'s nice to have it start out usable right out of the package. The delivery guy does give weird looks for the really heavy flat box *chuckle* I\\'m new to cooking and this pan is insane. I love, love, love it. I\\'m not new to baking and have made some killer desserts in it, too (like a one-pan skillet cookie). I can\\'t imagine not having this in my kitchen. How can you possibly go wrong?  A big skillet for all your big jobs.  Too bad the lid costs more than the skillet. This skillet came pre-seasoned and with more space than I will probably ever need.  It distributes heat well and cleans off without too much fuss.  If I have anything bad to say about it, it is that the handle is a bit thin and sometimes picking it up can be tricky.I say that last part mainly as a warning to people with petite builds.  It definitely takes some strength to pickup this skillet and you will want to be sure that you can do that with liquids and foods in it. I have had the Lodge 12-inch skillet for over a year, and liked it a lot. It provides relatively even heat to the food you\\'re cooking. It\\'s basically just as &#34;non-stick&#34; and easy to clean as Teflon-coated skillets, but without the risk of the coating scraping off over time and rendering the pan unusable. I bought this 9-inch version more recently, and it\\'s just as good as its larger cousin. Cast iron pans can truly last forever if you care for them properly, and for under $20 this one is absolutely a steal. For some time now, as my chef skills have been improving, I had been wanting a cast iron fry pan. This one was reasonably priced and pre-seasoned, so I bought it together with aT-fal E9180764 Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Expert Interior Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator Anti-Warp Base Dishwasher Safe 12-Inch Saute / Fry Pan Cookware, Gray, figuring that one or the other would eventually make a good replacement for my warpedRachael Ray Hard Anodized II Nonstick Dishwasher Safe 12-1/2-Inch Skillet, Orange. Almost everything about this pan was pretty much as expected. The cast iron is very flat and the pan retains and distributes heat very evenly. The trade-off is that the pan is extremely heavy, and of course, both the handles get blazing hot, making it doubly unwieldy. (I boughtLodge ASHH41 Silicone Hot Handle Holder, Redto solve part of the problem.) Obviously, the thermal properties of the cast iron are this pan\\'s big selling point, but I was not impressed with the \"non-stick\" qualities at all. I cared for the pan according to the instructions that came with it, and everything seemed to be working well. I didn\\'t wash the pan, instead opting to wipe it out with a cloth after using. Eventually, though, I tried to fry some eggs and that was the pan\\'s undoing. The eggs stuck quite stubbornly to the pan and after scraping as well as I could, I was left with no choice and had to wash the pan. After washing, I went to the Lodge website for instructions on re-seasoning the pan, and I thought I had followed them correctly, but when my pan emerged from the oven on the first seasoning attempt, it was sticky with a stubborn, baked in layer of dried oil. Now I\\'m left with having to scour, scrub and re-season (again) if I want to continue using this pan. In the meantime, the T-fal pan that I bought has become the kitchen workhouse. Nothing sticks to it and no seasoning is required.Cast iron makes great heirloom kitchen gear, but as good as this pan is for cooking everything but eggs, it\\'s a real chore to care for and doesn\\'t perform like pans with modern coatings. If you are a traditionalist with time on your hands, or you want to get a good bicep and forearm workout while cooking, this Lodge frying pan may be just the ticket for you. If you just want to cook food with a minimum amount of work and time spent maintaining your kitchen gear, I would recommend T-fal over this product. (That said, I went to the Lodge website, followed their re-seasoning instructions to the \\'T\\', and my pan is as good as new. Won\\'t try to cook eggs in it again, but otherwise, I\\'m happy, which is why it still musters four stars.) (This is an update of my original review, now that I\\'ve been using this frying pan for ten months.)I\\'ve been using cast iron frying pans all my life and was glad to see this being sold on Amazon at half the price my local hardware store gets for it.  It\\'s the first pre-seasoned cast iron pan I\\'ve owned.  I was skeptical about it and wondered whether I should look for one used or at least not pre-seasoned.However, the pre-seasoning works great, although after a few weeks of ownership I did season it myself, but this was because cooking at too high heat had damaged the pre-seasoning.  I\\'m totally happy with this little frying pan.  With proper care, there\\'s no reason why someone can\\'t still be using it a hundred years from now.Like all cast iron pans, it requires proper care. Here\\'s how I keep my cast iron pans in good shape:1) If the pan is new and not pre-seasoned, or if it\\'s been abused, I put it in the oven for several hours at around 100F with vegetable shortening covering the bottom of the pan.  If a pan\\'s been really abused, you may need to clean it with oven cleaner, but this is a drastic step that should be avoided if possible.2) Always cook at low heat.3) Before cooking, allow the pan to warm up at very low heat with cooking oil in it.4) Clean it with a dry paper towel.If a dry paper towel doesn\\'t completely clean it, use cold water and a sponge, but this will remove some of the pan\\'s seasoning. It\\'ll make you say \"awwwww\".  Make some eggses in it.  They fit nice.  It\\'s nonstick and you can use metal on it - best of both worlds! It\\'s a cast iron skillet. There is very nearly no better way to cook, unless you spend ten times as much on a pan. Seriously the only thing bad about it is that it\\'s so heavy that very young or very old people may find it a challenge to handle without difficulty. I bought a few diffrent sized Lodge cast iron pans to use on my grill and have loved the results. I use them right on the grates of my Weber Genesis to cook bacon, pancakes, vegtables, fajita meat, or anything else that would fall through the cracks. The pan cooks wonderfully and even. It cleans easily with water and good scrub. I always make sure to put a light coat of oil on the pan after I use it. I keep them outside underneath my grill (which is covered) and have not had any issues of rust. I have also used the pans inside to make a few different things in the oven and have had equally good results. Had ordered this skillet from Amazon but found it $4 cheaper at T.J. Maxx. It said \"irregular\", but other than a couple of pen head-sized divets in the iron, I couldn\\'t find anything else wrong with it. Cancelled the Amazon order (but still have the 5 quart dutch oven and the Sante cast iron loaf pan on order) which stated a 5-7 week!! wait to get the skillet. Was a little concerned about whether the pre-seasoning would really result in a non-stick first use due to some of the reviews on here. Well, I made bacon and pancakes in it this morning and NOTHING STUCK!! I was sooo happy and the pancakes and bacon were DELICIOUS! Cleaned it with water and a brush, dried it, placed it on the burner for a couple minutes, paper toweled some oil on its surface and it\\'s beautifully black and ready to use tomorrow. Recommend highly and can\\'t wait to get my dutch over and loaf pan. This is my go-to skillet. Love the build quality and even, uniform heat distribution. No chemicals or coatings to leech into my family\\'s food, or questionable materials used in this product. Thanks for putting out a good product, and making it in America! a little too small for what I was expecting but good for one person.  I am considering buying the next size up for two people.I like cast iron a lot though and this one is great for one person. this is my second cast iron purchase .the first one was 8 inch i love it so much that i decided to buy 12 inch. i seasoned even though it is already seasoned \"thank you guys from the review that tought  me how to do it\". i really give it 5 stars. well worthy I use this pan almost every day. I have a small family, but like to cook a double-batch of almost every main course for leftovers, and this pan allows me to saute without boiling everything. As with all Lodge Logic pre-seasoned cookware, I gave it another coat of seasoning (peanut oil) and baked it in the oven at a low temp for a few hours before using it. It is just as easy to clean as nonstick. I wash it with hot water and a nylon brush, then put it back on my gas cooktop for a couple of minutes to heat. Once all the water droplets have evaporated I turn off the heat and give it a shot of Pam before letting it cool. I cannot recommend this pan highly enough. As far as storage goes, I have a warming drawer in the bottom of my range that accomodates this skillet and my two 12\" cast iron skillets just fine. I rarely use high heat with cast iron. I allow enough time for it to get smoking-hot at a medium flame and adjust from there. This skillet ROCKS - and what\\'s better is that it\\'s made in the USA!Easy to clean too.  Would buy another! Wow! Huge number of reviews on this item and I don\\'t have much to add except WOW!  Been cooking for years, had heard all the buzz about cast iron but never used it much.  I wanted to get away from synthetic non-stick cookware and got this pan.  Great price, it IS basically non stick ( eggs are still a bit of an issue) and although I thought the size might be too big for my two-person household, it really is just perfect.Being cast iron, it IS a bit heavy, but if you don\\'t have any physical limitations, it\\'s perfectly workable.  Highly recommend!!!! Sometimes, only a cast iron skillet will do. This is a good one and comes at a nice price. At twelve inches, it\\'s quite large and pretty heavy, so be warned that chefs of slighter stature may want to try a smaller 10&#34; model to start. It\\'s a great skillet.  It\\'s very good quality.  I love the fact that it\\'s made in the USA.  I will continue to buy this brand.  This skillet is a little smaller than what I wanted, but I didn\\'t realize that until I got it.  But that is totally my fault.  I kept it because who can\\'t use a variety of skillet sizes?It wasn\\'t \\'seasoned\\' as much as I like, so I seasoned it again when it arrived.  If you\\'ve never used cast iron before, there may be a learning curve for you, but if you persevere you will figure out the best ways to use it.Overall, I really like the skillet.  It\\'s great quality, reminiscent of the old cast irons my grandmothers had.  It beats the last skillet I looked at locally, which was made in China...I did not buy that skillet.  I will stick with this brand from now on...and I think I\\'ll got for the 12&#34; one next time, since I do need a larger skillet. This is a perfect size for making a grilled cheese sandwich or to saut&eacute; some onions.  Great for cooking a hamburger.  Small and relatively light and easy to use and store it is a perfect size for when you dont want to take out a larger skillet.  It doesnt take up much room on the stovetop either for when you have several things going at once.  Highly recomemmended. After waiting a month to get the thing because it was back-ordered, I FINALLY got to try out my skillet. I love this thing! Most of my cookware is garden-variety non-stick and hardly suited to things like searing steaks or fajita meat.You can run this pan as hot as you dare without hurting it - works great for steaks, and makes an awesome cheese steak. The pre-seasoned coating works as advertised, and the cast iron gives good heat transfer and VERY even heat across the entire pan. I think I\\'m going to be using this skillet A LOT.A handy suggestion regarding cleaning that I stumbled across on another website... be SURE to use a hot pad while doing this! Immediately after cooking, fill the pan with HOT water (not cold; you could crack it!), put it on high heat, and bring the water to a rolling boil... this will lift debris off the pan bottom. Dump the water and immediately wipe dry with a paper towel, set on the (turned-off) burner briefly to dry completely, and wipe the cooking surfaces with oil.Another note - want those steaks well-done but juicy?  Buy the Lodge Logic 5-qt Dutch oven; the lid fits this skillet!  Sear both sides of the steak on medium-high (about 3 min each), then flip, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook as desired, flipping the steak once along the way (about 5 minutes per side for a small, well-done filet mignon).  Your cooking times may vary, but the combo of cast-iron skillet for searing and lid to keep things moist while cooking works exquisitely.  Brown, not black, outside... and tender inside. Lodge Logic is always top quality and this small size is very handy for a single person, side dishes or small ingredients of recipes.  I\\'ll probably get a lid for it to cover all possible needs. We have a lot of fish fries and we still prefer to pan fry over deep fry and this skillet is perfect! It fits on the outside fryer perfectly and cooks more fish at one time than our deep fryer. And the cast iron makes heat control a breeze! Have also used it for cooked cabbage and fried potatoes and onions! Perfect!!! I have a number of Lodge logic pieces...grill pans, skillets and a Dutch oven, and I love them all.My family has cooked in cast iron since I was a kid. I have stainless skillets, also, and they have their uses, but for the most part I reach for the Lodge skillets. I especially like this one for making gravies and sauces. I like it as it does cook stuff better than our non-stick frying pans.  It is a bit harder to clean, but I suspect that goes with the territory. Pros:Durable cast ironGreat for pizzas and steaksCons:Takes a while to get seasonedNot the best for some things like eggs even after seasonedCan\\'t leave it soaking lazily in the sinkOther:The 12 inch skillet fine for making pizzas but for everyday use its a bit too large, I also have an 8 inch which is perfect Now, do not buy this if your marriage is rocky because one bang on the head with this skillet will knock you cold. Just keep that in mind. I was surprised and immediately put off by the bumpiness of this skillet\\'s surface. I thought it would be detrimental to the sear and add to the pan\\'s stickiness. I was wrong. This performs just as well as my decades old and entirely smooth old 9 inch skillet. This thing is indeed extremely heavy and the helper handle is indeed helpful. But the size is necessary. When it comes to searing steaks or frying up a mess of bacon (or, for you vegetarians, eggplant), there\\'s no replacement for cast iron. A tremendous bargain; just make sure to add something on to qualify for \"Super Saver\" shipping. THIS THING MAKES A GREAT INDIVIDUAL FRITTATA! IT HOLDS FOUR EGGS PERFECTLY. COAT PAN WITH BUTTER, AND COOK ON MEDIUM LOW HEAT UNTIL THE EGGS SET UP. FINISH UNDER THE BROILER, THEN LET REST FOR FIVE MINUTES. FRITTATA WILL SLIDE OUT EFFORTLESSLY. CAST IRON IS THE ORIGINAL NON STICK SKILLET. IT WORKS BETTER THAN TEFLON!  YOU WANNA IMPRESS YOUR GIRLFRIEND WITH RESTAURANT QUALITY FRITTATAS? GET THIS SKILLET!!! I am glad I received my order today. Can\\'t wait to use my skillet. I found a glass lid in my cabinet that fits perfect on it too! That made it that much better. Make sure to use two hands when holding. It is heavy and the real deal! I first bought it to hang next to the large skillet; as a joke. But then I made a sausage, biscuit, egg sandwich one day and..... perfect! BUT- there is only me. If you have a slew of kids than those non-stick baking rings may be your answer. They tell you it is only 3 inches wide, so don\\'t be like this one lady who bought it anyway and then gave a negative review on how small it was. If you don\\'t know what 3 inches is, than ask your husband. Maybe good as a spoon rest, ashtray, collectible but not very useful unless you want to melt a pat of butter! I\\'m still using the Lodge Cast Iron Skillet that my mother got for a wedding present in 1954! I give this pre-seasoned version as wedding gifts, housewarming gifts, and to those kids stepping out into their own apartments. Cast Iron is ALWAYS a superior value for the money, and this pre-seasoned version takes the hassle out of \"getting it ready to use.\" Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a Lodge Cast Iron Skillet and Dutch Oven! She\\'ll hand it down to the next generation. A must have for EVERY kitchen This is a necessary item in anyone\\'s kitchen.  It is just the right size and of course you can\\'t go wrong with cast iron.  It comes seasoned (as described), which is critical. This is exactly what I was looking for! It\\'s the perfect size for most purposes, it cleans easily and it weighs a ton.. (ha!)  I don\\'t use the rubber handle cover though...it doesn\\'t fit tightly and I don\\'t feel it holds the pan securely, so I just use a pot holder if I need to move it or pick it up.  I definitely recommend this pan...it\\'s been my &#34;go to&#34; pan for everything since I got it! One great skillet for frying bacon and making corn bread. Have had great success with the skillet. would recommend it to anyone. I love cooking with cast iron.  I have several old pieces that are well seasoned.  I was visiting someone who had a big cast iron pan like this.  A chef and she used it for everything. It is heavy, but cooks nicely.  I contacted the manufacturer and they said they will be coming out with a glass lid sometime in May. Hurrah! I have often heard in the past how people liked their cast-iron cookware.  Thought I\\'d try it with a small purchase, so I ordered this small fry pan.  The very first time before I used it, I added about two tablespoons of lard, set the gas stovetop on low, let it melt, then used a paper towel to wipe it all over the Pre-seasoned pan.  It is now my favorite pan, so I ordered the next size larger to go along with it. And the lid from the 3 qt. chicken fryer fits perfectly.  A good size when the kids aren\\'t home and I\\'m only cooking for one.  Cleans up very well. Holds a whole fryer or 6 chops plus sauce. Use it all the time. Love how it sears and finishes in the oven. I would love a lid for this skillet. My wife uses this little guy almost every day .. it never gets put away, just sits on top of the stove waiting for it\\'s next use.  It has never rusted, has had to get re-seasoned only once due to a slight over drying on the stove top after washing, and nothing sticks in it.  It cleans almost too easily.  Too be honest, there is nothing negative about this little skillet at all, making it the perfect skillet.  Highly recommended. The skillet is just as advertised, but I hate the seasoning aspect.  True it was preseasoned, but suggestion it to continue seasoningmaybe after time it will not be necessary.  I keep the skillet in the oven, would not stack with other cookware for fear of scratching the other cookware. Do not wash in soapy water, it will rust!  Almost immediately.  Had to re-season mine. Now, I rinse in hot water and dry with paper towels.  I really want to wash it!!!!! LOL We really like the fact the skillet is pre-seasoned.  The additional small handle makes it easy to go from stove-top to oven.  Even cooking and easy clean-up. Lodge Logic is Great!! its cheap and cooks amazing! this in particular is very big! It will hold a entire Paella for 10 people! as it should be its heavy you will love it. I remember my mom and aunts used the old iron frying pans when I was growing up, so we wanted to give it a try.  It\\'s amazing how well food cooks in these things.  It stated that it comes pre-seasoned, but went ahead and seasoned it again anyway.  Words of warning, open your windows.  Baked iron frying pan will stink up your kitchen.  Have only used it a couple of times, but food comes out well.  I\\'m only giving it four stars because these thing s are a pain in the butt to maintain. My skillet has a big rough unseasoned part in the center of it.  At first I thought this was just a part of the roughness of the surface, but it really differs completely from the rest of the surface, both in appearance and use.  This was quite a disappointment, especially as I remember my father and grandmother cooking with cast iron skillets.  I loved those pans and everything that came out of them.That red handle is amazing. Pre-seasoned skillets is the only way to go. I use it every day and sometimes oil it so the skillet isn\\'t bare. Very easy to clean. A bit heavy but it beats Teflon pans, health wise. We received this yesterday. Our pancakes are fluffier and we are using less oil.We haven\\'t tried an omelete yet.  We will be getting a good workout handling this pan.  Hope it lasts us forever. Packaging was great. Pan is great quality. I just bought it and have put it thru many lunches and dinners and its very durable. I was always scared of cast iron because I know that if not taken care of them well they can rust. I decided to give it a try with this small pan, because it was decently priced. I love it. I planing on buying more. I recommend this pan. Just make sure you completely dry and season it with oil. I\\'ve used it over and over and still looks like the day I received it. I had always wanted a cast iron skillet, but for some reason, we never got one.  I\\'m so glad I decided to just order one.  I LOVE it!  Bacon and eggs in the morning taste amazing in this pan! Arrived perfectly on time and very well packaged.  This little frying pan is exactly what I wanted, you can sear a food and then safely put it into a hot oven.  It is already seasoned and cleans easily with warm water. I have the 12\". I think every kitchen should have at least one cast iron skillet. It can be used for anything but the best use I found for it is \\'Shakshouka\\' (look it up!) served to the table boiling hot in the a cast iron skillet. It\\'s also great for steaks, burgers and hotdogs if you want to prepare them on your stove although Lodge has skillets that are better suited for that.I heard that Lodge is the brand to get. I know there are more brands but I haven\\'t tried them. Why change a winning team? I like the quality of this one and I\\'m now looking to get the 10\" too. btw, you can get the common size skillets offline at prices very similar to online prices and even better sometimes. I got this 12\" for about 1/3 of the online price at a local store. i have received the item but have not had a chance to use it yet. but looks good and i hope that the food doesn\\'t get stuck like it has happen to others I LOVE Lodge cast iron cookware.  It is great quality and, with the exception of the enameled line, it is made in the U.S.A.  I now look for this in all cookware and tableware before I purchase (and please take a note, Amazon - it would be REALLY helpful if you\\'d list where items are made in the product descriptions).  These pans get better and better with use, and you aim for that \"black glass\" finish that another reviewer mentioned.  At that point you\\'ll get good nonstick performance.  Until that point, however, be aware that even the pre-seasoned cast iron is not going to give you the nonstick performance of a pan with a true nonstick coating.  I use my cast iron for as much as possible but keep a couple of nonstick skillets for frying hash browns and eggs because, frankly, my cast iron still tries my patience with those items.  I mention this so, if you do order this or some other cast iron skillet, you don\\'t toss out your nonstick skillets as soon as the UPS guy arrives with your new cast iron.  It\\'s not gonna be sufficiently non-stick to fry eggs for awhile (unless you don\\'t mind cooking with alot of oil or butter).  That said, cast iron works BEAUTIFULLY for just about everything else. I use this for a lot of cooking.  It has replaced all my regular skillets and is now my favorite piece of cookware.  I keep trying to get the oil seasoning coat right.  I still get a small amount of sticking when cooking eggs, but i think that could be a temperature problem.This thing makes an awesome steak.  Love the sear!  The silicone handle was a nice addition, but is not useful for lifting, you still need to use an oven mitt because this thing is heavy. Lodge makes the BEST quality cast iron cookware. I own several other brands of cast iron and this is the skillet I use the most. I would buy this item again, I give it a AAA+++. I love my Lodge cast iron skillets. This is the perfect size for two fried eggs or a nice fluffy omelett that is thick enough to hold saut&eacute;d veggies. I like to make an omelett in the oven with it. Great size for making small pies and so on. My particular skillet had chipping on the inside towards the top and scraped paint on the rim of the other side. Because of this, I will never buy cast iron online again. I would rather be able to inspect it for signs of  potential rusting and so on. What would make a 10\" skillet better? How about a lid that you can use for frying eggs on? How about a lid that\\'s tight enough to make it a dutch oven? How about a pan that\\'s deep enough for deep fat frying. (olive oil of course!) Well Lodge makes just such beast, it\\'s the \"Lodge Combo Cooker\" Same size, only comes with a lid that doubles as a flat griddle.If you need a 10\" skillet get the combo cooker instead you will be much happier. I\\'ve rid myself of all my frying pans and replaced them with Lodge Pre-Seasoned Skillets.  They are the best because the food is cooked evenly and clean-up is a breeze!  You just need to remember to season your pan with about 1/4t of oil before putting them away and they will last a lifetime.  I have ordered almost every size via Amazon:  8&#34;, 9&#34;, 10.25&#34;, 12&#34; and 15&#34;.  All I need is the 13.25&#34; pan and my set will be complete!  The perfect companions for cleaning your cast irons can also be found on Amazon:  (1) The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail.  (2) Lodge SCRBRSH Scrub Brush, 10-Inch. I was missing the 8 inch skillet. Extremely fast delivery (2) days!!! and well packaged. I made my very first cornbread with it and it came out perfect. Clean-up was a breeze, washed it with hot water only, NO SOAP!!!. Oiled it and it\\'s sitting right on my stove top waiting for it\\'s next job. I love the skillet. Lodge is the best and lasts forever if taken care of properly which is a no brainer.Thanks Amazon - Love you too.Grandma Nel This cast iron Lodge pan is fully seasoned, ready to go. I use an electric range and was presently surprised at how well it transfers the heat from the burner. To say that I love it is a moat point. I will be buying more! This pan is so heavy even when empty it made me use it less and less. Trying to clean the thing in an average size sink is a real chore. It is so sensitive to water it will rust in an instant. Personally, I found that with just the standard pre-seasoning, chicken breasts and stuff do stick to it. It has its place for searing, but all of its high maintenance issues made me averse to using it. Cannot profess enough, how much I love this skillet. When I first started using cast iron, I didn\\'t know how to properly use it. Now I pre-preheat the skillet. About 60-30 minutes before I\\'m ready to start cooking I put the skillet on medium heat and pretty much forget about it for 10-20 minutes, season with oil and turn of the stove. When I\\'m ready to fire it up, I heat it up for 3-5 minutes on medium-high and I\\'m good to go. After a few re-seasonings, this skillet is a dream, cannot express how much I love this thing! This is a great addition to our kitchen.  Even though it is way bigger than our electric burners, it still works great as the whole pan heats up.  So for sauteing it is almost like having a large skillet.  We have also made large casseroles in there as well, as well as chocolate cake, as you can put the pan in the oven. Aluminum and teflon cooking surfaces both have serious health concerns, so I won\\'t cook on anything but stainless steel or cast iron. I had a large cast iron pan that was not a Lodge, it was awful, it did not heat evenly and did not keep its seasoning. I own other Lodge ironware so I knew it would be a good bet this would be a good product too. So far I have not been disappointed, the skillet has performed flawlessly, it heats evenly and keeps its seasoning. I highly recommend this skillet and other Lodge ironware products. We are new to the cast iron world after we researched and found out majority of non stick pans are so dangerous and bad for your health.  So far so good but it is a lot of maintenance involved.  What you can and can\\'t do etc.  Still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good.  The only thing that I\\'m not used to is how hot the handle gets.  I have burned myself multiple times because I forget!  I also think things things are SO heavy.  I\\'m pretty strong but I\\'m thinking I might just skip my weight lifting workout and just cook with my new heavy cast iron :)  (joke).  So far so good.  I love the size for smaller meals.  i trust the awesome reviews on amazon and the price is terrific! Needed a good priced pre seasoned old fashioned cast iron fry pan, this one fit all my parameters.  Little extra handle opposite the main handle is good for weak wrists like mine with a hot mitt or  Ove Glove Very nice cast iron skillet, I\\'ve never been disappointed in any of Lodge\\'s cast iron pots and pans, just my opinion but I think they\\'re the best! Reading the reviews of Lodge skillets, I get the feeling that the cast iron skillets have a considerable cult aspect. I have an ancient 12\" iron skillet that works very well for browning meats and for good heat distribution. These skillets are cheap and last longer than one\\'s lifetime. This particular item needs another seasoning at home and will need some use before it reaches it\\'s full potential, so don\\'t get discouraged at first. One caveat: do not start with frozen foods, I did and the frozen glazed-seasoned vegetable meal stuck like crazy glue. It took me almost an hour to scrub them off. This is cautioned at the Lodge website, but not at the product user\\'s guide. I really enjoyed this skillet for cooking small meals, but was very disappointed when the handle fell off soon after I received the skillet. I use this for a small chicken fryer 2 or three pieces with lid (Lodge Logic L5IC3 Cast Iron Lid, 8-inch  ) and any time cook on the stove using an 8\" skilletthis will last a 100 years If it dose not grow legs and walk awayI rub all my cast-iron with vegetable oil after each use the perfect nonstick surface gets better with use and can be renewed if needed This is the pan I started with to go back to cast iron after years of trying all kinds of teflon coated and plain steel types.  This pan came to me perfectly seasoned and ready go.  Haven\\'t had any trouble cleaning and re-seasoning it.  Just wish the law of physics would change to allow it be a lighter weight! We have the 8\" skillet, along with the 12\", the round griddle, and 2 dutch ovens. The 8\" skillet and the griddle are used daily. I threw away all of our non stick pans years ago and switched over to cast iron. When seasoned correctly they work as well as regular nonstick, except they cook much better!Get this pan piping hot, add a tiny drizzle of oil to the meat after seasoning then toss into the pan and you will get the most perfect crust. Then turn the heat down a touch to finish cooking. Also nothing beats using a cast iron pan for frying potatoes and onions! Perfect every time!Cleanup is so easy too. We just wipe out any food bits with a paper towel and run a scrubber brush around with some water and rinse. I usually set the pan back on the burner to finish drying off while I finish cleaning up then wipe a small dollop of bacon grease  over the surface so it will be ready for next time. If you have some hard to clean messes all it takes is a tiny bit of water and let it simmer for a minute and it will release the food, then just rinse, dry, and add a bit of oil or grease.After using these for so long I just can\\'t see myself using anything else to cook on. This pan is the perfect size for 2 people. I can cook 4 pieces of Turkey bacon when I cut them in half and then I can use the pan, with the very little amount of dripping and all the seasoning to make the eggs!I have used this pan inside the house and out on the fire pit.I have made an &#34;apple brownie&#34; and regular brownies in it in my inside oven.Because it\\'s LODGE it cost\\'s a bit more, BUT it is well worth the lifetime of use you will get from them. They\\'ll outlast you, your grandchildren will be able to use them and then theirs too probably.I have used other cast-iron skillets and pans. I believe the quality of LODGE is much better and when pre-seasoned, which this comes as, it starts accumulating flavors from all the food you cook in it.Never wash LODGE with soap and water. You can boil water in the pan if something is really stuck. I do leave &#34;stuff&#34;, herbs and oil residue in my pans after I use them. If you use water then please completely dry and if you store it with a lid put a spacer between the lid and the skillet. You don\\'t want rust on any cast-iron.LODGE makes wonderful scrappers for cleaning and there are silicone handles to remove hot pans from the oven or around on the stove. The skillet is bigger than I wanted but it is a great product and will last forever. It is hard to beat cast iron cooking about anything. This is the real thing. Don\\'t know if they make it in the US or Bangladesh, but it does a great job on my blackened fish.Will one day use it as a present for one of my ignorant, undeserving, pseudo-chef of a friend. What can I say that hasn\\'t been said already?  The only new cookware entering my house will be Lodge cast iron (and not some cheap knockoff).  I\\'ve used it for several years and every time one of my old (non cast iron) pots dies, it gets replaced with Lodge.  It\\'s just the best for cooking, easy to clean, and the handles never break.  This stuff lasts forever.  Can\\'t stand the other stuff, that scratches or has handles that dry out or loosen.  This stuff is just the best. This is the 4th Lodge Logic brand cast iron pan I have bought and I love them all.  This one is perfect for sauteing small items or for cooking 1 egg.  Love it! I am enjoying making old world foods like my mom and grandma used to make.  I kept thinking .... (before I got this)  &#34;Why isn\\'t this turning out the same as theirs did?&#34;  SECRET:  It\\'s the skillet!  The old fashioned iron skillet.Keep it clean, but not scrubbed with harsh pads, or other.  Make sure it is THOROUGHLY DRY when you put it away.  Before I use it each time, I rub a tiny bit of Coconut Oil all over the inside of the pan to just \\'season it\\' a little bit.  I think it will last forever.  I hope, because it\\'s a super fry pan.  (Just like grandma had.)  ;) HUGE pan. awesome for campfires, making large cornbread, chili, etc! Worth the investment easy to pick up with 2 hands Ya\\'ll out there looking for the best price on cast iron cookware should  look no further. First off, buying this product means you\\'re buying American. You\\'re employing Americans to manufacture this item. The quality is fabulous! Easy to clean! I\\'ve had no problems with any of Lodge cast iron cookware. It heats evenly and retains heat compare to stamped sheet metal or aluminum cookware. This cookware lasts FOREVER, you\\'ll be willing this to the kids. No, I do not work for Lodges or represent them professionally. I recently purchased the Lodge Logic skillet specifically to cook a corn bread recipe. I\\'ve been a single guy for the past ten years and cast iron was low on my list of cooking tools since I was not really convinced that it was healthy. The thought of the pores in the metal gathering little bits of food for posterity made me a tad uncomfortable. Even though I grew up in the late forties and fifties with my mother frying everything in her twelve inch cast iron skillet, I was a bit squeamish about having one myself. Add to that the seasoning process and long term care required, I passed for years. Well.... this skillet is great. The preseasoning was a big selling point as were the many positive reviews on Amazon. Upon receipt of my order which included the lid, I had to try it out. In short, the corn bread came out perfect and I have since used it to sear a pot roast which worked even better. I will be using this skillet more as time marches on and am pleased with the purchase. The only negative opinion that I have concerns the shipping. This item was poorly stablized in the box which caused the skillet and lid to come together causing a few scrapes. The damage was minor but could have been worse. I know I\\'ve got to give this pan a chance and only have used a couple times because my eggs stuck horribly both times. I\\'m hoping with time this will be as effective as my non-stick pan. I grew up with cast-iron (pre-Teflon days)and know the benefits.  I moved away from it with the new (at the time) non-sticks that made their appearances from time to time with new and better coatings.  I have reverted to cast-iron because of superiority.  I still use the non-sticks for casual and fast cookings but use cast-iron the majority of the time.  I love to cook and like to feel connected to my cookware (weird, huh?) Once they are seasoned properly (properly is key), they are very hard to beat for anything other than recipes that call for non-reactive cookware.  What the cast-iron novice needs to understand is that it takes a while for cast-iron to become the be-all.  One that isn\\'t familiar with cast-iron will expect too much, too fast.  With some understanding, that novice will have the patience to wait it out, so to speak.  The payoff is worth it. Without that patience and understanding, the newcomer will get become disillusioned and even disgusted and shove it to the back of the cupboard.First of all, the \\'pre-seasoned\\' is little more than hype.  Yes, any cast-iron does need to be seasoned but it takes much more than one introduction of \"oil to heat\" to achieve that seasoning. One has to cook several, if not many times in cast-iron for it to become indispensable.  After the first few times of cooking and cleaning the pan, coat the inside with an almost undetectable smear of vegetable oil and heat it up briefly on the eye.  Don\\'t let it smoke.  Allow it to cool down and wipe excess oil off.  There won\\'t be much because as the iron heats, it expands, allowing the oil to actually soak into the iron. When it cools, the oil molecules are trapped.  It prevents rust and makes the pot or pan easier and easier to clean the more it\\'s used.  Additionally, the initial roughness of the cooking surface itself will smooth out.  A patina will emerge from the scraping and stirring. This new surface will readily release food when you clean it. It is an eventual process but it will occur.  You will see it happening.  This will sound strange, but you will actually fall in love with it.  You have nurtured it to it\\'s present wonderfulness and will actually look forward to using it.  It becomes more than just a way to cook food; it becomes almost an integral part of the food being prepared.Again, don\\'t be discouraged after using it a few times.  Stick with it and follow the above instructions and you will reap enormous culinary rewards. It will make cooking an even more joyous experience.  If you don\\'t know how cooking can be joyous, maybe tolerable is a more operative description. this is a pretty heavy iron skillet and i love it, it distributes heat very well and keeps heat for good period. it is easy to take care of and works well in the oven as well. It\\'s not the biggest, but its size lends itself well to our gas burners. Heats evenly and well, and is the perfect size for toasting spices and seeds- I use this on cumin a lot, prior to grinding it for my cooking. It\\'s also the perfect size for an egg or two. Great little skillet, highly recommended. I had never used cast iron before, but I heard it was great for anemics and people that want to avoid the chemicals in nonstick pans. I have overcooked things in it, washed it incorrectly, and generally made every mistake in the book at some point. Every time I re-season it looks as good as new.When I first received it, I washed the pre-seasoning off and re-seasoned it with with grapeseed oil. Then I cooked fatty meats in it for the first several times I used it. I made sure to preheat it to avoid sticking. When I got some burnt on food, I scraped it off and washed it as normal. I should have cleaned the pan by boiling some water in it to loosen the remaining food. The soap had removed the seasoning, but the pan was fine and was easy to season again.It is a healthy choice and helps support American jobs. Very nice and the best part is this is made in the USA. It is a very heavy pan so if you are older it may not be a good choice unless you have help in the kitchen. Just wonderful!  Wish I would have bought a set of cast iron skillets years ago.  I\\'ve been collecting the Lodge Brand&#8230;love them!  Easy to clean and take care of.  Food taste SO MUCH BETTER!  Grandma\\'s knew best!They will last a life time.  (We\\'ve waisted so much money though the years with lots of pans&#8230;what a shame)! This pan is a little heavy and it supposedly weighs 5 lbs...but with food added makes it seem like 10 lbs. However it cleans very easily..just rinse and scrub briefly with a metal brush or pad.  It seemed to be already seasoned well..but i just added a bit of corn oil before cooking anything 1st time and wiped it over inside and stuck in oven ..and in 1 hour of sitting in oven at 400 degrees..it seems to not have ANY issues with sticking afterwardsThe food is great after cooking inside it and it is so easy to cook with. Just add the ingrediants and put a lid over it and set in oven and come back 1 hour later and it tastes as nice as a dinner at a high priced restaurant.Btw would recommend getting the lid that goes with this by Lodge too...but problem is it weighs as much as the pan..so look at another 5 lbs added to already 8-10 lbs of pan and food to lift out of oven. There is an extra handle on front to make it easier to lift with two hands also. hard to clean and maintain. Bought this just to bake cornbread in.  Might use it for other things as well, but for now, it is perfect for my needs.  I did do additional seasoning when it arrived by lightly coating with oil and baking in our toaster oven at 400+ degrees (out of doors to let it smoke real good!)  Did this 4 times and it really added a nice slick coat to it.  Cornbread falls right out! First we thought we got a big pan but this turned out very good size to do anything.  It took few days to get used to it but we are using almost everyday for cooking.  I will keep this all the way. pros: cook food very deliciouslycons: not easy to wash.  heavy.  12 inch is still big(heavy) for three of us.  I recommand smaller size for everyday use.But I like this pan. Time tested product like your mother used when you were a kid.  To me food tastes better and these can be used in the oven for baking.  I also bought the 12 inch one and will get the 15 inch later. This is the workhorse of my kitchen.  I would say I use this 75% of the time.  10% for All clad skillet,  10% enameled dutch oven, and maybe 5% non stick skillet for eggs.  It\\'s the only way I cook steaks  (even over grilling).  I\\'m no stranger to a grill either.I have this skillet, and the 15&#34; cast iron skillet when I cook for larger groups. I bought these as a gift for the cook in the family (my husband). He loves them. We were using the non-stick store bought set which of course we all know we have to be careful with what we use in them as they scratch easily. After some research online I felt that cast iron was the way to go. I know that they come pre-seasoned but I will be seasoning them anyways as I want his first experience using them to be a pleasant one. I have read the many reviews of people who love them and those who did not. The fact that they are made in the USA is a huge selling point for me and the price is right. I believe I may be ordering more pieces for him. We purchased two skillets and a 5 quart dutch oven. I found a wonderful recipe book to go with the packages. This is a great pan.  It is heavy, so the double handles are a plus.  It does a nice even job with frying. My mother has owned Lodge for a long, long time and she will not give me her set. My sister will be inheriting the collection and she can\\'t cook worth a scratch. So I decided to slowly build my own collection and I started with this monster. When it sits on the stove top it intimidates all of the other pans around it. A big, brooding high quality skillet with attitude. I also purchased the silicone handles for it as it stays hot for what seems like days. A great, great item it just does not have the family history of cooking infused in it like my mother\\'s collection. This is an excellent product. The reviews that say otherwise seem to be mostly from people who are not familiar with how to properly care for cast iron. These do not rust if taken care of properly. Stuff doesn\\'t stick if these are seasoned properly. I purchased cast iron after trying several brands of pots and pans. I found out the Teflon (and anything similar) is toxic and can be very dangerous if the surface is scratched. Others were not reliable in keeping food from sticking, no matter how much oil or butter I used. My mother and grandmother (and various aunts) used cast iron, and I\\'d never tried using it because I didn\\'t want the upkeep that goes with them (you can\\'t leave wet to dry, have to season each time, don\\'t use soapy water, can\\'t stack with other items, etc).  However, after having numerous frustrating experiences with other pots, pans, and skillets, I decided to fork over the money to get the cast iron that I knew would work, but is more work to use. I have actually found that using cast iron is less work in the long run. Especially if you season it well each time. I don\\'t have to scrub food off that has been stuck on, because food doesn\\'t stick on. Even things like eggs, which are notorious for sticking, are easily cooked and the slight sticking of any residue is very easy to just peel up with the spatula. You don\\'t even have to use water to clean these. You can dry scrub with salt. If you do wash wet, you just use hot water and a brush, if necessary, and dry thoroughly (immediately, so it doesn\\'t rust). Then, you rub oil into it, inside and out (which actually takes a lot less time that I had anticipated), and store it (preferably on its own). The great thing about seasoning is that it is automatically ready to cook with the next time you need it for things like stir-frying, saut&eacute; type stuff, etc. The oil is already on it and it\\'s ready to go. The more you use it, the more well seasoned it gets, and the better the surface for non-stick appeal. If you care for this, it will last your entire lifetime and the lifetimes of generations to follow. They never wear out and I\\'ve never heard of one breaking or in any other way becoming dysfunctional. You can use them on a variety of surfaces, and they\\'ve done really well for us during things like camping, over fires... When our son was born, it was important for us to have as much non-toxic items as possible. I threw out all our nonstick and bought lodge pans and all-clad pots/pans. The chems. in nonstick must be reformulated by 2010 due to know health risks. Crazy!! We bought this lodge pan, th indoor lodge grill pan, and the small pizza pan. They come preseasoned to give you a start, but you still of course, will need a while(about 6mths) to get them perfect. My son is two now, and my pans are a natural non stick that are way better in heat distribution and non sticking. Made in the USA in the south, by people who know cast iron. Much heavier and better made than the China imports. Just bought this pan recently. It is everything the previous reviewers have said. The only negative is that you must be very carefull when using this pan on a glass top electric stove. I love cooking on cast iron skillets. This is a great product. Ive used it about 50 times with no rusting and easy clean up. There is just something comforting about cooking in a cast iron skillet. Food tastes better and the evened out head distribution cooks food much faster.  I would but another one. We bought our first one 40 years ago for camping. Now we still use it several times per week. We just bought this one to have a bigger size. We have many pieces of expensive cookware but nothing works as well as this American classic.Searing a steak or saut&eacute;ing eggs are examples of everyday use. It is also the only pan we can put in the oven or use on our barbecue grill. It lasts forever and is indestructible. These were gifts to my grown kids & their families.  I have been using this since 2007, love the product & price.  Reliable & healthy, food tastes & looks better!  From frying eggs, etc. & baking corn bread to making gravy, perfect!  Makes the best roast chicken, roast pork & roast Greek style boneless lamb. I often add whole unpeeled potatoes or sweet potatoes together in the same pan!  After roast is done, I just put it on a platter to rest, place still hot pan on stove top turned on high, & make the best gravy!  Yum!  A must have for every cook who strives for the best home cooked food. I bought the 10 inch and now have this 12 inch unit.  Just threw out the old one we\\'ve had for 40+years.  This pan is gorgeous, if a pot can be gorgeous.  Cast iron is the only way to cook and I do a lot of cooking.  Of course, the main attribute is the even heat distribution and constant temperature of the pan once you get it up.  Need to get a couple of bigger units, say a 6 and an 8 quart along with a sauce pan and I can throw out all our old Farberware (will have to do it when she is not looking).  Now this is not a Le Cruzette, but who cares; it does not cost $130 and it\\'s made in America. Every body knows that a good cast iron skillet is an essential tool for frying chicken.  I purchased this, at a really great price, from the Amazon warehouse deals.  Could detect no signs of any usage.  It worked beautifully on the induction burner.  Now my friends want me to get them one \\'just like this\\'.  All I need is for someone to return another one in the pristine shape of mine.  I do need a lid though.  No 12 inch lid available that I can find. 2008 I purchased a Lodge 12&#34; cast iron skillet for $25.00 on Amazon and used it as my main piece of cookware. I use it for almost everything, last year I started to use it to make Pan Pizza, the top of the 12&#34; skillet is 12&#34; but the bottom is 10&#34; , a 10&#34;: Pan Pizza is enough for me but if I have company I would have to make two pizzas, so I purchased the Lodge 15&#34; cast iron skillet and the diameter of the bottom of the 15&#34; skillet is 12&#34; it is only two inches more but it seems like it is a lot bigger and more filling ( I posted a photo)I enjoy reading the customer reviews of the Lodge products and somtimes find useful tips for cooking with mine. Will use this on the weekend trip to Camp with the Boy SCouts.  Look like it will work great I hope. I have been so scared to try Cast Iron Skillets  that I almost put it off again. However I did order the Logde Logic 12 and 101/4 inch skillets a few weeks ago. I wanted to use them for awhile before posting so I would know what I was talking about. I have really enjoyed cooking in both of these skillets. I find myself using the 12 incher more. But the clean up has not been a problem and the cooking has been great.... At least my husband says so... LOL. I have not had any issues with sticking or hard to clean... I just make sure I clean it after cooking (I don\\'t let it set) and only with water and a brush and season after every use. I would recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook. Yeah, that\\'s right, I called it cute! When I pulled this little guy out of the box all I could think was, &#34;Awwww, how adorable!&#34; It\\'s perfect and exactly what I wanted! I got the tiny one and is perfect for cooking single meals for myself or when I\\'m using my larger ribbed cast iron skillet to make smaller things like garlic toast or a couple of brats. My larger skillet is just that, larger and takes up an entire square on the stove so, with this being so much smaller it works perfect for cooking duel burners.I don\\'t think I could be any happier with this skillet! So happy with my first cast iron skillet purchase! :)It\\'s beautiful, heavy bottomed, and perfect. The fact that it\\'s preseasoned makes it a lot easier on my part. Also, made a beautiful skillet buttermilk cornbread with this new purchase; rose beautifully and was absolutely delicious. Thank you, Lodge! I bought this last year as a fluke after hearing about cast iron on cooking shows. Well I must say that the performance of this pan outshines my other pans (Calphalon Commercial NSF that I have had for over 10 years. The old style made in the USA). Pros:1- Pre seasoned, but I added another seasoning layer myself.2- Even heating- it comes to temperature and stays there.3- Easy clean up with a little boiling water, a brush, and if its really dirty I brush in a bit of salt.Con:It is heavy.I heartliy suggest that everyone get one of these pans.After trying it out, I bought a 5qt. Dutch Oven from Lodge. It too is a fantastic pot for the price. We\\'ve purchased the 6 inch one and the 9 inch one and couldn\\'t be happier with them.  The quality is excellent, clean up is a breeze and food cooks so nicely.  We purchased one of those \"chainmail\" deals to clean these pans and those work like a charm.  We\\'re so pleased with the Lodge cast iron pans and are so glad we converted from \"non-stick\" to cast iron. Good ole Made-in-the-USA cast iron...of course it\\'s awesome. Lodge has been making this stuff for a long time and they know what they are doing. It arrived ready to go...pre-seasoned and included the silicone hot handle grip. Those silicone grips sell for $6 all by themselves! I paid $23.99 for both shipped! (I am a Prime member) AWESOME I use this to cook meat everyday.  Just buy a quality turner like the Dexter-Russell 4-by-2.5-Inch Stainless Steel and Walnut Pancake Turner.  Scrape the bottom after cooking and wipe the excess oil with a paper towel and you\\'re set for the next time you cook.  Very easy to clean and cook with.  You can also save money on a sandwich press.  I make grilled cheese and press sandwiches all the time with this.  Just buy a lid and press down.  This pan is one of my best buys on amazon. I use this skillet so often it basically just lives on my stove. I live alone and usually cook for one, and this skillet is the perfect size for me. I debated between this and theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 6-1/2-Inch Skillet, and I\\'m glad I chose the 8 inch pan. I\\'ve since seen the 6-1/2 inch skillet in a store, and that would\\'ve been too small. My current favorite entree is chicken fried tofu (I\\'m vegan), and this easily holds two slices of tofu, and will accommodate 3 slices with just a little pushing. So this small skillet lets me fry up 2-3 slices of tofu without wasting too much oil - perfect!I\\'m a recent convert to cast iron, and I\\'m cooking more than ever just to have an excuse to use the skillets (in addition to this one, I also own theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle, which is perfect for tortillas and pancakes, and theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker, which is perfect for...well, everything else). The sear you get with these pans is remarkable. I frequently saute mushrooms and fry up veggie patties, and I\\'m still enthralled with the perfect sear on the patties and the lovely browning of the mushrooms. Yum!One note: I personally recommend not cooking with olive oil in cast iron pans. The pans heat up more quickly and get hotter than my other pans, so the olive oil starts smoking sooner than I\\'m used to. And once it\\'s smoked, it leaves a sticky residue in the pans, no matter how hard I scrub with a brush under super hot water. I\\'m sure others have used olive oil successfully, but I\\'m not always attentive enough to keep it from smoking and getting sticky. I\\'ve been happily using safflower oil, which is a neutral flavored, high heat oil that cleans up easily without soap.Bottom line: I love this pan, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who\\'s willing to use and care for it properly. I really like this and cooking is better than my stainless steel.  Cookware without the nonstick cooking is better for you. Missed the cast iron pots and pans my Mom and Grandma had...still think there is really nothing better, you can keep all the new fangled cooking utensils...the \"old\" work beautifully... I have the 10\" and the 12\" and love them, so I got this little one for when I just want to make ONE of anything. The Lodge Logic line is great, easy maintenance, great cooking results.  The change in taste is remarkable. The silicone handle fits perfectly and the size of this pan is awesome!  Just a pro tip for cast iron: pre-seasoned is a bit of a misnomer.  The seasoning they have on the pan will keep it from rusting and is good for greasy foods, but its not good to start with something like, say, eggs.  You will need to add additional seasoning to the inside of the pan for that.  I suggest starting off with something like bacon or sauteing onions, and then seasoning the inside of the pan only a couple of times before you attempt that fritatta or omelet you were super excited about.  Think of a pre-seasoning on a cast iron pan like a primer on a wall, you still need to add to it.  This pan is high quality and with proper care will last generations. Works excellent, is non stick once fully seasoned, and USA made.Not much more to say, other than we really like the silicone handle, it stays cool enough to use without a mitt, yet removes easily if we ever want it off, and slips back on quickly and easily. Too often, a 12\" skillet is just not quite big enough.  This one is perfect for cooking for a family.  It makes a good griddle, is non-stick and holds a lot of food.  No more ever-so-careful stirring to avoid spilling over the edge.  It does heat up a bit hotter directly above the heat source, so the heat distribution is not perfect.  But that is the nature of cast iron.  Overall it is a must-have pan and the one I always reach for first.Kitchen Collection (website and store often found in outlet malls) makes a lid called the \"Extra Large Multi Cover\" that fits this pan perfectly and makes the pan even more versatile.The skillet is rather heavy, but with the helper handle, it has not been a problem moving the thing around even when full of food.  It is impossible to pick it up and pour anything out of, but then, there are no pour spout indentations.As some reviewers have noted, the bottom appears pebbly, but that is a complete non-issue.  The pre-seasoning is a start, but I just lightly washed it and then reseasoned it first thing.  It has been entirely non-stick for everything from eggs, to green beans to meats since.The pan\\'s actual measurements are 15\" across the top and 12\" across the interior bottom.  Despite the written description and the pan\\'s label (and Amazon\\'s title when I bought it) that state the pan to be 15 1/4\", it is and is supposed to be 15\".  I even contacted Lodge about the discrepency and was told 15\" is the proper measurement.  I took away a star for the mislabeling. Very tiny, but it is the real deal and very cute  Looks great with my collection and would make a cool paper weight ITS HEAVY. 10-15lbs...LOVE that cast iron! it takes while to heat up, but it definitely keeps the heat going!i\\'ve used this skillet a few times now, some that come to mid are the roasted quails and veggies, and another for fired and roasted prawns and paella. it washes easily and takes hot oil dispersement much better than most since it is porous.  its a wonderful tool for any kitchen chef to use, and don\\'t forget the wooden spoon! i love it that you can use these on the stove, and then stick em\\' in the oven to finish off the cooking of whatever you may need to braise or sear first. Because I have a moderate case of arthritis in my hands, I was a little concerned that the 12\" skillet might be too heavy to lift, but -- thanks to the second handle -- it\\'s manageable. I love it! Here is the deal...it can be used on the stove, in the oven, over the campfire to make the best meals you ever had...fries up bacon perfect then oh, the eggs...pancakes golden brown...create tons of corn bread mixes. Make a stew or fry up a batch of potatoes or fried apples, green tomatoes...you get it, it does it all..A few thoughts: it should never, never be put in the dish washer...just hand wash with warm water...it hates soap. Be sure and keep it well seasoned. It is HEAVY. It has a hot handle...beware. Don\\'t drag it around on your glass top stove...Be sure to put this in your will as several family members will want it as it is a piece of cookware that last for generations if you give it the proper care...Get several sizes...this was just for a one serving cook project. I have a large one that is awesome as above. As I\\'m getting older, I needed a pan a little smaller, but large enough to cook 4 hamburgers at a time.  This does the job without the heavy weight of a bigger skillet. I love the size, and Lodge products are always fantastic. I was able to fit it inside my Weber grill, close the lid, and let it cook on one side while other food items were also cooking on the grill. Great size for side dishes. Both my wife and I like to cook potatos and eggs in the morning.  But several high-end nonstick pans were ruined by the high heat needed to brown the potatos.  We dug our lodge 12\" skillet out from our camping suplies to get us by while we were looking for a nonstick that would hold up to the heat.  At first, it felt rediculously heavy and we had to be careful not to grab the handle.  But after a week or so, we both came to love using it!  It browns the potatos beautifully and it realses the eggs very nicely too.  No more worry about ruined nonsticks or any potential release of harmful chemicals when the coatings disintegrate. Can\\'t believe this thing for the price.  Heats so evenly and cooks perfectly... it\\'s really changed the way I cook (and how often I cook!).  Get one! I\\'ve already got several pieces of Lodge cookware, so I knew what to expect. I\\'ve already used it for cornbread, a couple of breakfasts and a pineapple upsidedown cake. It works beautifully, of course. The enormity of this thing simply cannot be overstated. If you have a normal sized stove, you should expect to lose the usage of one of your adjacent burners/elements.It\\'s so damn big that I\\'m not sure I\\'ll use it that often. I expect I\\'ll be happy to have it when I need it. This skillet is easy to use, cooks food very evenly, and cleans up easily using just hot water and a scrub brush. As long as you dry it after use on the stove (at low to med temp), then add a few drops of oil and spread it around with a paper towel while the skillet is still hot, and let it cool that way, you\\'re good to go. Excellent quality, and the extra handle helps because skillets are heavy. i bought this pan to avoid the initial seasoning process. i\\'m not really sure it made much of a difference.  i do clean it with water immediately after use, and then heat it to dry and apply oil.  i\\'m sure i\\'ll get to the point where i\\'ve built up the seasoning layer and achieve a \\'non-stick\\' surface, but i\\'m not there yet.  i do really like how meat tastes cooked in this pan as differentiated from teflon pans.  i can go for a higher temperature with this one and brown meat better. I have gotten two of these...one I primarily use to fry eggs, and the other as a saute pan when cooking for myself. Same old lodge logic product. I am not as knowledgable as many of the reviewers but these are great pans particularly given how inexpensive they are.  I now have a 9\", 12\" and grill and couldn\\'t be happier! We have two of the 12&#34; skillets. This pan is the best tool for perfect roast chicken, hands-down. Line the skillet completely with thin-sliced potatoes that have been tossed with 1/8C canola oil. (my husband carefully arranges these like a beautiful cracker arrangement on a cheese tray.) Salt, pepper, season, and truss your chicken. Put your prepared bird on the bed of potatoes. (I usually brine the chicken for at least 6 hours in a lemon brine&#8212;google \\'Thomas Keller roast chicken brine\\' for ideas.) Cook in an oven holding 475 F for 25 minutes, then reduce the temp to 400 to cook until the chicken is done. (this depends on the size of the chicken; chicken is done when the thickest part of the bird has reached 165.) Remove the skillet from the oven, and you will have a golden bird, on a bed of potatoes that have been seasoned in all that lovely roast chicken juice. Some of them are going to be thin a crispy and stuck to the pan&#8212;I usually eat those before anyone else gets the chance. (perks of being the cook.)Also brilliant for, you know, eggs and bacon, etc.. But for me, the roast chicken alone is worth having one of these heavy guys hanging around the kitchen. I love this skillet! I have both the 12 and 10 inch skillets and couldn\\'t be more happy with them. I don\\'t like non stick due to the toxic chemicals and you must always replace them, even the high quality ones that are expensive must be replaced no matter how careful you are with them. But cast iron lasts a lifetime, acts just like non stick and doesn\\'t have anything toxic in them. =D Happy cooking! I have a 12 inch cast iron skillet that was a bit too big for everyday use, especially when making omelettes for my kids (small sized), so I ordered this skillet. It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I use it all the time: grilled cheese sandwich, omelette, melt butter, small quesedilla, etc. I really do wish Lodge made one between the 12 inch and 8 inch skillets, maybe 10 inch? Anyway, this size is great if you have small children or cook only for yourself. This is the best all around pan to use for cooking. Keep it clean and seasoned and you can cook anything in it. I got this larger size so I could cook everything from pancakes to curry in one pan. It fits several slices of bacon really well. Clean up is easy, simply boil a  cup or two of water in it and then use a stiff brush to scrape off the junk. Then dry well, season and put away. The only drawback to this pan is that it is pretty heavy. I have to use two hands to safely lift it, and pouring out of it gets tough because of the weight. Also scratches glass cooktops, so make sure you lift it on a glass cooktop, never slide it. What a great skillet for the price My wife and I have been looking for a non-toxic/non-stick method of cooking for a long time. The old fashioned Iron Skillet is it! \"Zero Stickage\" Just ensure you clean and care for the pan as described and it will last a very long time. 5 stars!!! I found that I am not able to pick the 15 inch one up with sufficient ease to use regularly. that thing is super heavy. this one is nice I can pick it up easily. I have used it almost everyday since I got it. Better for the environment - not using dishsoap and I can cook eggs in it without sticking.  I have never been able to do that in aluminum no matter how much oil I use Super cooker! Love this skillet!! Anything you cook will be done so to protection, let me tell you, a d no matter how you cook it- electric, gas, camp fire or coals, cast iron is it. When this went to an Amazon Lightning Deal, I couldn\\'t pass, & I recommend you don\\'t either! I got the 10.25&#34; cast iron skillet to use instead of a regular non-stick and I find it to be just as versatile. So far I have done, eggs, pasta re-heating, rib eye steak, and Italian roast beef in au jus re-heating.  I find that it gets a crisp coating on the eggs much better than a regular non-stick skillet.  Only downsides to the cast iron is it takes longer to get up to temperature and longer to cool down and its def heavier than a comparable size modern non-stick skillet. So far I have been able to clean it with just hot water and a sponge and once dry I give it a very very  thin coating of olive oil and store it. I actually purchased this skillet at Wal-Mart for about 10 or 12 bucks. I forgot the actual price, but still not much for something that can last a lifetime and is made in the U.S.A. Really, we as consumers should try to buy as many American made products as we can when we have a choice. Of course, when it make sense to do so.So far this is a great skillet for small jobs. It says it\\'s pre-seasoned, but honestly I think that\\'s just to keep it from rusting at the stores. The real seasoning comes from usage. The more you use it, the better it will get.I have to say that I really love this skillet. It\\'s usually found sitting on my stove because I use it so much. I pretty much use it daily.Here\\'s a list of what I have cooked in this skillet: fried eggs (2), scrambled eggs (3), omelletes (2), fried chicken breasts, baked chicken breasts (2), chicken fajitas, beef fajitas, sauteed veggies (onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc), grilled ham & cheese sandwiches, grilled cheese sandwiches, and more!I have pretty much designated this skillet as my egg and breakfast skillet. It\\'s the perfect size for frying eggs. There\\'s smaller skillets, but personally I don\\'t think they give you enough room. Granted, I haven\\'t tried them but I think the 8 inch pan seems to be the best size for me.Here\\'s a bit of advice on this skillet. Use it, and use it often. The more you do, the better it gets. If you want to use it fry eggs, then try what I do. I pre-heat the pan on low heat. On my gas stove, I set the dial on 2. Of course, stoves vary but hopefully that gives you an indication of how low I have it. Any lower, and you will hardly see a flame. It will take a bit to warm up, but it will definitely warm up good.Once it\\'s ready, I coat the bottom and sides of the skillet with butter. If the butter burns and turns brown, then it\\'s too hot. If it melts quickly and coasts the skillet without burning, then it\\'s the right temp. Crack a couple of eggs into the skillet and let them cook until they are ready to flip. Go a head a give the skillet a shake when the eggs look just about ready to flip. I recommend the Lodge skillet mits for this purpose. Hopefully, your eggs will slide around. If not, then give them a bit of a nudge with a spatula. You might have to work underneath them a bit to loosen them up.Once you have the eggs sliding around, with a quick flick of the wrist you can flip them over. Or you can use your spatula, but that\\'s no fun. It will also make you look like a pro if you can flip them with a flick of the wrist.If this didn\\'t work for you and your eggs stuck, then your skillet just needs some mileage. The more you use it, the better it will get. Remember to wipe down and oil your skillet after use. That will protect the skillet so it can be ready for the next time you whip something up.Anyway, great skillet! I should buy another! LOL I didn\\'t realize just how big this is, (totally my fault), but it is a great pan. We look forward to lifetime use! overall a great product, the preseasoned makes this skillet ready to go out of the box, highly recommended, great flavor There are tons of ways people can season cast iron but let me share something I\\'ve yet to find anywhere: use a cotton, BBQ basting mop for seasoning. After you season this enough, you\\'re golden. I make everything I can in mine & bought many other Lodge pieces after this one.1. I initially washed mine with baking soda & warm water because I didn\\'t think it\\'d hurt. It didn\\'t. Don\\'t use any petroleum based soap on this!!!2. After thoroughly towel drying your pan, heat it on the stove. Get it hot & dry but not too fast. Start @ medium low heat. Why preheat on the stove? Cast iron is porous so it makes more sense to get the pores open so you can clog\\'em with grease. That\\'s your seasoning.3. After it\\'s hot, apply whatever grease you like. Sunflower oil worked best for me. If you see smoke, take it off the burner.Instead of using X many paper towels & burning your fingers, rub the oil into the pan with the basting mop. You want a light coating of grease but not too greasy. Mop can be washed & reused; & you\\'ll never burn your fingers.4. Bake @ 300 degrees until it\\'s nearly dry then add another light coating of grease.I applied 6 coats of grease then stopped seasoning. After the pan cooled, I heated it on the stove, added a little butter, & hardly any egg stuck. Yes, making eggs is the best indicator because it\\'s simple & cheap. If anything sticks, just scrape it clean, or boil water in it to remove anything stuck. After the pan dries, season again. DON\\'T WASH WITH SOAP!!!!You know the pan\\'s seasoned nicely by the sound your metal spatula makes. Initially, it sounds loud & annoying. After a good seasoning, it\\'s quieter & smoother. I use my skillet everyday & don\\'t regret the purchase 1 bit. Not only does it work well on the stove, but it makes a mean deep dish pizza in the oven. Works great as a baking stone too. Made in USA, nice price, & requires a little persistence. After that, it\\'s all easy. Some say to just cook bacon or hamburger in it for a while. Yes, you can do that, but my way is cheaper, faster, & cleaner. Although, cooking bacon does smell good.Like a good roux, patience, focus, & passion work well here. Good luck.update: If you don\\'t wanna fry bacon, use coconut oil. Makes the kitchen smell good too. I melted coconut oil, applied a generous coating, then baked it outside on my charcoal grill. Frying an egg is the best test, & I love it when the cheese easily lifts off the pan. Toasted cheese is yummy. I love cast iron cook ware and this one fits the purpose; however, the weight is not as heavy as the others I own; not so happy about that. As with all lodge cookware this will last forever and is almost impossible to damage.But Be Warned, This is one HUGE pan. My 14 inch pans look lost inside this thing.That said, I like this pan very much. What else could you sear 2 24 ounce ribeye steaks together in? I have my grandmother\\'s beautifully seasoned 12 inch Lodge skillet.  Unfortunately it does not have the helper handle on the side opposite the normal handle.  This is a heavy skillet and when it is almost full of any steaming hot liquid it must be moved carefully. Out of respect I still use it for certain recipes, but my 10-1/4 inch Lodge skillet is the workhorse in my kitchen.Fortunately for you the \"new\" Lodge does have the helper handle...and you can use it for a life-time and still pass it on your children.I have 30 years experience in the manufacturing industry and have been responsible for the purchase of several thousand tons of metal castings.  All cast iron is not equal.  Lodge has the best cast iron for food service available anywhere in the world...and their quality control is second to none. I love this pan for meat, It cooks one of the best steaks I have ever had. Get it sizzilin hot throw some butter down then the steak and quickly put the lid on so your house does not fill with smoke. Browns a roast great. Not so great for eggs so far maybe will get better after seasoning for a while. easy to clean, just add some water while still warm and scrub with brush then wipe out with dry cloth. Very solid construction and will have for a very long time. Highly recommended!!! As far as cast iron goes, this is about as perfect as can be. Although I always diligently season my cast iron pans after nearly every use, and could get away with a pan that wasn\\'t pre-seasoned, I still think buying a pre-seasoned pan makes a lot of sense because you can get started cooking right out of the box. It also gives you a head start on your own regular seasonings--it takes care of those difficult first 3 seasonings for you.On my first use of this pan, I pre-heated the pan for 3-4 minutes, used a little canola spray (not much) and fried an egg. It slid around just as well as a nonstick pan! Amazing.Of course, what can I say about cast iron that hasn\\'t been said before? It\\'s just brilliant, and I use it whenever I cook meat these days--it just always tastes better. Lodge is as reliable and as inexpensive as I could ask for. Lodge Logic has a good reputation for their cast iron products. We have a wood stove and I was looking for cast iron products that we could use if there was a power outage of some kind. I\\'m guessing the &#34;pre-seasoned&#34; process of these items are done in mass production. I will have to season it again as there are some bare spots around the rim. No biggie though, The shipping was free and arrived in two days. (prime member) I\\'m sure I\\'ll be using this for years to come. after going through all of the coated pans, teflon, enamel, I have come to realize that the old traditional cast iron pans are the bestthe lodge logic is made here in USA and is absolutely the best buy around Took the plunge and bought this cast iron skillet as I was tired of buying &#34;throw away&#34; nonstick pans. Did some online research and seasoned it well before using-it works great. Cooked eggs this morning and they came out completely stick free! Will be buying more cast iron-need a griddle next. This is my favorite cast iron skillet.  I also have the 10\" Lodge Signature Series skillet with riveted Stainless Steel handles (Lodge Signature 10-Inch Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet with Stainless-Steel Primary and Assist Handles) but this 10-1/4\" skillet is *much* easier to handle, perhaps because the handle is shorter and you are gripping closer to the heavier mass.Another advantage is that a lid is readily available for this item:  both an iron lid (Lodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Cast-Iron Lid), and a glass lid (Lodge 10.25 inch Tempered Glass Lid).The disadvantage is that the handle on this all-iron skillet gets very hot.  Some sort of holder is required.So far, a glass lid is not available for the 10\" Signature Series skillet (link inserted above).  And the iron lid that *is* available for the 10\" Signature Series skillet (link inserted above) was priced at $45 directly from Lodge.  Add shipping costs to that also.This 10-1/4\" skillet with the 10-1/4\" glass lid on it is lighter to use in combined weight than the 10\" Signature Series skillet with Stainless Steel handles alone, even before a lid.See also my review on the Lodge 10\" Signature Series skillet with Stainless Steel handles (link inserted above). Food Network\\'s Alton Brown recommends a cast iron skillet for cooking steaks. (...)The great price of this skillet prompted me to give his recommendation a try.  As was promised, his technique works great. Over time, our skillet has slowly replaced most of our much more expensive pans and I love being able to not worry about scratching or damaging it when using metal utensils. I use this for my spoon rest to.  They are so net and I love the size of them, they are just net to have on display. This is the kind of kitchen gear that doesn\\'t cost a lot, you keep for years, use for everything and wonder how you did without it. We almost never put this skillet away. It\\'s in constant use. For weekends, we make a big fry-up breakfast (yeah, not good for you, but once a week...) and do bacon, eggs, tomatoes and sausages. It\\'s great for any kind of frying, chicken, fish and you can even do a steak though I will say that this is a smokey process indeed.To pan-grill a steak, grease the pan lightly and sear the steak on each side, testing the meat for done-ness by pressing on top. Rare steak feels like flabby flesh. Well-done feels resilient. One clue is to test your hand; rare is the firmness of between thumb and forefinger, medium is your thumb muscle and well done is your wrist. Pinching these will give you an idea of how done your steak \"feels.\" When finished grilling, remove steaks to a warm plate and you can deglaze the pan with a swish of cognac or wine, add a swirl of butter for a very luxurious sauce.Washing this pan requires hot water..and no soap. If there are burnt bits, scrub them out with salt. Rub the pan dry. This keeps the seasoning from being removed by detergent and makes the pan almost as non-stick as a teflon pan, though of course not quite. Sorry for the long review - for the short review, count the stars!I\\'m a bit of a purist. I always season my cast iron - new, or used (hey, I don\\'t know WHAT someone else used that old piece of cast iron for - maybe cleaning auto parts). I sand it down to bare metal, starting with about an 80 grit and finishing with 200.Then I season. The end result is a glossy black mirror that puts Teflon to shame. There are two mistakes people make when seasoning - not hot enough, not long enough. These mistakes give the same result - a sticky brown coating that is definitely not non-stick, and the first time they bring any real heat to the pan, clouds of smoke that they neither expected or wanted. I see several complaints here that are completely due to not knowing this.But there were a few pieces I needed (yes, needed, cast iron isn\\'t about want, it\\'s a need), and this was one of them, so I thought I\\'d give the Lodge pre-seasoning a try. Ordered last Friday, received this Friday - free shipping, yay!The first thing I noticed was the bumpy coating. The inside is actually rougher than the outside, and my hand was itching for the sandpaper, but that would have defeated the experiment. This time, I was going to give the Lodge pre-seasoning a chance before I broke out the sandpaper. So I scrubbed the pan out with a plastic brush and a little soapy water, rinsed well, put it on a medium burner, and waited. Cast iron tip number one - give it a little time. Then give it a little more time. Cast iron conducts heat much more slowly than aluminum, so you have to have a little patience.Then I threw in a pat of butter, and brought out the natural enemy of badly seasoned cast iron - the egg. And, sure enough, it stuck - but not badly, just in the middle. A bit of spatula work and I actually got a passable over-medium egg. Hmmm. But still not good enough. So I cleaned up the pan, and broke out the lard.I have only one justification for using lard. I don\\'t remember Grandma using refined hand-pressed organic flax oil, or purified extra-virgin olive oil made by real virgins. Nope, it was pretty much animal fat in her iron. A scoop of bacon grease from the mason jar beside the stove and she was ready to cook anything. Grandaddy wouldn\\'t eat a piece of meat that had less than a half-inch of fat around it. \"Tastes like a dry old shoe.\", he\\'d declare if it was too lean. In the end, I\\'m sure their diet killed them, but they ate well in the meantime. Grandaddy was cut down at the tender age of 96, and Grandma lasted till 98. Eat what you want folks - in the end, it\\'s pretty much up to your genetics.So I warmed up my new pieces, and smeared a very thin layer of lard all over them - use your fingers. Towels, especially paper towels, will shed lint, and lint in your seasoning coat doesn\\'t help things at all. Besides, it\\'s kinda fun.Here\\'s cast iron tip number two - season at the highest temp you think you\\'ll ever cook at - or higher. If you don\\'t, you won\\'t get the full non-stick thing, and the first time you bring it up to that temp you\\'ll get clouds of smoke from the unfinished seasoning. I put my pieces in a cold oven, and set the temp for an hour at 500 degrees (F, not C). Yeah, I know, Lodge says 350. Lodge doesn\\'t want panicked support calls from people whose house is full of smoke. Crank the heat up.You have two choices here. You can put a fan in the kitchen window and blow smoke out of your house like the battleship Bismarck under attack by the Royal Navy, or invest in an oxygen mask. You will get smoke. You will get lots of smoke, especially if you\\'re doing several pieces at once, like I just did. This is a good thing - that\\'s smoke that won\\'t be jumping out to surprise you the first time you try to cook with any real heat. The goal is to heat until you don\\'t get smoke, and in my experience, 500 degrees for an hour does that pretty well.Let the pieces cool in the closed oven. Then re-grease and repeat. And repeat again. And don\\'t glop the fat on. Just enough to coat. More thin layers are better than fewer gloppy layers. I managed four layers last night without my neighbors calling the fire department.Seems like a lot of work? Look at it this way. It\\'s a lifetime commitment. Treat your iron well, and it will love you right back like you\\'ve never been loved before. And this is pretty much a one-time deal, unless you do something silly.The end result of my all-night smoking up the kitchen exercise? Dry, absolutely no stickiness, black as a coal mine at midnight and shiny - but still bumpy - could it possibly work with that rough surface?I put the skillet back on a medium burner, put a pat of butter on and tossed in a couple of eggs. After the whites had set a little, I nudged them with a spatula, and they scooted across the pan. I\\'ll be... it works. My wife came back from the store and wanted scrambled eggs. If there\\'s anything that cast iron likes less than fried eggs, it\\'s scrambled. But it was the same thing all over again. No stick. No cleanup. Just a quick hot water rinse with a brush in case something got left on the pan (I couldn\\'t see anything, but hey), then I put it on a med-hi burner till dry, put a thin coat of lard on the pan and waited until I saw smoke for a minute. Let cool and hang up. Done.So. do I like the bumpy texture of the Lodge pre-season? Nope. Does it work? Yes, and contrary to my misgivings, it works very well. My wife pointed out that even some Teflon cookware has textured patterns in it. The Lodge pre-season isn\\'t a perfect surface out of the box - but it does give you a big head-start. After a night\\'s work, my iron is ready to face anything, and you just can\\'t beat that.Lodge makes a great product. For the quality, durability, and versatility, you can\\'t beat Lodge cast iron. Plus, it\\'s made in America. I like that. If you\\'ve never experienced cast iron cooking, you\\'ve just been cheating yourself. Plus, the price, for a piece of lifetime cookware, is insanely cheap.And my sandpaper is still on the tool shelf. As much as I love and cherish my genuine (and no longer manufactured) Corning Ware Pyroceram cookware, it\\'s just not the right stuff for making cornbread, or, more specifically, Johnnycake.What\\'s the difference, one may ask?  Well, cornbread baked in glass or lightweight metal comes out with a soft barely formed crust.  Johnnycake adds the crackle of a fried crust, and the only way to attain it is with a cast iron skillet, like Lodge\\'s Logic Pre-Seasoned 12-incher.Since it\\'s pre-seasoned, it\\'s like inheriting that coveted been-in-the-family-for-years skillet without waiting for someone to die. On top of the stove, nothing fries chicken better or makes crustier hash brown potatoes. Many gourmet chefs insist on cast iron for searing meats and preparing pan gravy or sauces, no matter how the meat is going to be finished. If you really want to see the family\\'s eyes pop, serve up some plate-size pancakes for breakfast this weekend.In the oven, cast iron holds the heat better than anything else.  Scalloped potatoes bake up wrapped in crusty goodness.  Ditto for a pineapple or peach upside-down cake.But this pan really struts its stuff when you\\'re in the mood for honest-to-goodness Johnnycake.  You start by preparing a double batch of your favorite cornbread recipe or mix.  While the batter rests, put your Lodge Logic skillet on the stove, lay in 2 or 4 strips of bacon and fry \\'em up good and crisp.  Drain the bacon on paper towels and carefully tilt the pan until the sides are coated in bacon fat.  Pour off the excess and put the skillet in the oven as it preheats.When the oven\\'s ready, stir down the batter, pull out the oven rack and dump the batter in all at once.  Listen!  Hear that sizzle?  That\\'s the outside of your cornbread frying!  Close the door, let it bake and then cool it about 15 minutes before you turn it out on a cutting board.  Great Googly-Moogly, that\\'s some fine eatin\\', especially if you sprinkle a little crumbled bacon on top of the butter and honey!You say you\\'re a vegetarian?  Gotcha covered!  Melt half a stick of Nucoa margarine in the skillet instead of frying bacon.  Butter will burn at these temperatures and the delicate flavor will cook out, so save the butter for when your Johnnycake comes out of the oven.You could even use a cooking spray, but don\\'t come crying to me if it\\'s not as good.  I tried to warn ya.Oh, and here\\'s a delicious bit of irony.  I just saw Emeril Lagasse making Johnnycake on Food Network.  Was he using one of his Chinese-made EmerilWare cast iron skillets?Nope.  Emeril\\'s favorite skillet is a Lodge.

By formulating the right metal chemistry, and creating the exact mold tolerances, they offer the finest line of cast iron cookware available.Lodge Logic is a revolutionary new line of seasoned, ready to use cast iron cookware that\\'s even better than your Grandmother\\'s. An electrostatic spray system evenly coats the entire surface of the iron with a proprietary vegetable oil prior to the cookware moving into very hot industrial gas ovens. The high temperature allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the cast iron surface creating that prized heirloom finish.It may not stop squabbles over the beneficiary of the family\\'s cast iron cookware, but it does eliminate the time and effort of seasoning cast iron for the customer while offering the superior look and performance of home seasoned cast iron cookware.Lodge is a zero hazardous waste stream foundry. Lodge designed a vegetable oil recycler for the seasoning process to reduce waste and unusable oil is recycled and used as biodiesel generator. Lodge uses recycled and biodegradable packing materials. Reuse of foundry sand used in the casting process is recycled and unusable sand, working to purify the water of the local streams and planting trees to improve air quality and beautification.Care and Cleaning of your Lodge Cast IronAfter cooking, clean utensil with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. (Avoid putting a hot utensil into cold water. Thermal shock can occur causing the metal to warp or crack).If you are having trouble removing stuck-on food, boil some water in your pan for a few minutes to loosen residue, making it easier to remove.Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to the utensil while it is still warm.TIP: Do not let your cast iron air dry, as this can promote rust.Store in a cool, dry place. If you have a cover, or lid, for your utensil, place a folded paper towel in between lid and utensil allowing air to circulate. This prevents moisture from collecting inside the utensil, which can cause rust.TIP: The oven is a great place to store your cast iron; just remember to remove it before turning on the oven.NEVER wash in dishwasher.If for some reason your utensil develops a metallic smell or taste, or perhaps rust spots (maybe a well-meaning relative washed your utensil in the dishwasher or with soap thinking they were being helpful), never fear. Simply scour off the rust using a very fine grade of sandpaper or steel wool and refer to the section on re-seasoning at the lodge website.Don\\'t be fooled by cheap Chinese imitations -If it\\'s not Lodge, it\\'s not Made in America.MADE IN THE USA.

Seasoned over time, many handed down from one generation to another, cast iron cookware has been this country\\'s favorite cookware for over one hundred years. Nothing cooks better than cast iron.I highly recommend this cookware.  With proper care and the available handle guards, this cookware should last several life times. This is a great cast iron skillet. The size is perfect for cooking many things and I love the removable silicone handle cover. What a great invention! Love my cast iron pan.  Always season after using.  Use it for everything.  Great conduction.  Fun to cook with.  Highly recommend. This is very well made, heavy and sturdy. I think this is something which will last forever because there is nothing to break! No plastic handles, no coating, it\\'s just a basic cast iron skillet. It\\'s pre-seasoned, but it isn\\'t as non-stick as a new teflon pan. Your eggs will stick if you don\\'t maintain the seasoning of the pan. But apart from that, it sautes and cooks very well. It heats evenly, but a little slowly. And don\\'t use soap to wash it, just like the instructions say, just a stiff brush and hot water. The only complaint I have is that the pan comes with a large piece of card that is stuck to the surface with some kind of stickum. When you peel that card off, the stickum peels the pre-seasoning off as well. It cooks great out of the box. It is heavy, but its cast iron, so that was to be expected.It was seasoned well, and surprisingly for its heft, it heated up rather quick on our electric stove top.A word of caution, if you have a easy clean glass electric stove top, and you\\'re particular about how it looks, pay close attention to not scratch the stove surface. We haven\\'t, and not sure if we could, but regardless we are gentle with it when cooking. Slow cook or quick sear, this pan is versatile. Perfect for camp fire cooking as well as in your kitchen. Pre-seasoned is, as usual, a good starting point. The only con is cleanup and maintaining the seasoning, but that\\'s easy if you plan it in to meal prep. This is the brand to buy. I highly recommend purchasing the matching lid. You won\\'t regret this purchase. I suppose you\\'re either a cast-iron sort of person or you\\'re not. I love a properly cured cast iron skillet; a properly cured surface will yield lifetimes of good service.I wouldn\\'t rely on the pre-seasoning schtic, however. I don\\'t know what process Lodge is using but their pre-seasoning is pretty lame; the skillet is all one could ask for. The seasoning isn\\'t.For you folks who\\'ve never used properly seasoned cast iron, if it\\'s well seasoned nothing sticks to it. It\\'s as good to much better than \\'non stick\\' ware. It can be washed with detergent (keep it out of the dishwasher, though) though that\\'s rarely necessary. Maintaining cast iron is little bother and the heat distribution is as good as ware that costs dozens of times as much. Pros:Perfect size for stovetop Pork Chops....Lid from my Lodge 5 Qt Dutch Oven fits this 12 inch Skillet.Nicely made AMERICAN product!Already seasoned.Cons:Kinda heavy.Had a deep pit on the inside coooking surface, but expect it will fill in when seasoned more.Cheaper at Wally World and you can pick out the one you want. Straight up, this pan is heavy (check the prod. descript. shipping weight). You will definitely need two hands when you\\'re moving around hot food on this baby. I use it to cook crazy mounds of meat. I basically cook all my meals for the week in it. Again, with it\\'s heft, the handle is pretty much worthless. But look on the bright side: if your wife gets crazy angry with you, at least she can\\'t wield this skillet and try to clock you with it. For serious, it\\'s heavy. This is a great value on a cast iron skillet. Only thing I found is that even though they say \"pre-cured\" it isn\\'t. Take the extra time to cure it yourself before using. Lodge is superior manufacturer of quality cast iron cookware. While cooking with cast iron requires a bit of practice and a bit more maintenance than regular cookware it is so well worth the extra effort. The food tastes better, easier cooking and best of all, you will have a piece of cookware that will last for generations to come. I highly recommend going to [...] for added info. I purchased \"Cast Iron Cooking For Dummies\" for a reference and recommend others afraid of cast iron cooking to purchase their own book - whether it be this one or another title. Besides that, I am attempting to get \"back to basics\" in life and what better way than to go cast iron. Economical, efficient, versatile, durable & long lasting. First off, I\\'ve never owned a cast iron skillet. I\\'ve been eyeing this bad boy for over a year because I was very weary of buying one as I usually just stick EVERYTHING in the dishwasher and do NOT always clean up the kitchen (skillet included) right after I cook dinner. But, it just takes some getting used to; it hasn\\'t caused me too much pain yet. LODGE is definitely the brand to go with as they\\'ve been around a long, long time and the quality seems great. Best of all, their products are made in the USA.I ended up re-seasoning my skillet, as I figured the oils they used at the factory were most likely GMO. I ended up seasoning with organic coconut oil and have had no issues yet. I love cooking with my new skillet. I experimented by frying an egg in it without treating the pan. It worked fairly well. The nest couple of times I used it I added extra oil.Now it is stick-less. Cast iron is heavy Tough for beginners! Learning to season and take care of the pan is difficult, but once you get the hang of it, teflon pans are disgusting. It is cute. It would makes a nice wall hanging or coffee tablet knick knack or candy dish. It is a good spoon rest at the stove. Makes one scrambled egg for an egg sandwich. Is  a good butter melter.Good place to stir up flour and water for a gravy thickener. It can serve as an ash tray. Being cast iron it is nearly indestructable. I love to cook in this pan, especially now that I use induction.It\\'s really heavy, though, and you can\\'t grip it when heated.It\\'s also a bit of a pain to make sure nobody uses soap on it. Good but sharp Edges on handle. I had to remove the sharp Edges on the handle so I removed the coding on it. Had to put oil on it to protected.This is problem with All Cast Iron products that I have. We took this pan camping and it was awesme. It is big enough to cook breakfast for 8-10 people at once. There was little sticking. Lodge Logic L5SK3 Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet, 8-inch has lived up to their hype! Very well made and works like great cast iron should. If you learn how to use and clean these, they will last several generations with ease... What can I say it does what it is suppose to. You should re-season it with lard. The factory seasoning isn\\'t very good. I saw the skillet came seasoned, but re-seasoned it anyway.  It worked fine.  After about 5 uses, it became non stick.  Lovely pan. It\\'s as good as or better than my vintage Griswald which is supposed to be the Cadillac of cast iron skillets.  And I love that it is made in the USA I bought this skillett as part of an order for several Lodge Products. My son and his wife were very happy with the Cast Iron cookeare. I have many Lodge cast Iron cookware products and highly recommend them. From skillets to stove top grills and Dutch Ovens Lodge is my favorite and always rates a 5 star review. Cast iron is lovely to cook with.  It heats up well and holds heat beautifully.  Most cookware has trouble really searing a steak because the big slab of cold meat cools the pan down.  Cast iron sears like nothing else because it\\'s big and heavy and holds heat very well.  This property can be a liability if you\\'re looking to vary heat quickly, say when doing a delicate cream sauce.  Aluminum is better in that situation.  Iron is also very prone to rust - so you can\\'t let it sit in sink with suds, or even put it away wet.  You have to clean up promptly, without soap and then dry thoroughly.  I\\'ve found a quick wipe with some oil on a paper towel and then drying upside down in a warm oven for a hour is perfect.  Keeps it seasoned and rust free.  The oiled surface helps the performance of cast iron cookware.  Is this a lot of trouble?  Not really - but it\\'s a lot more trouble than my other forms of cookware.  Burnt on cheese makes some fairly permanent stains.My other beef concerns the longer of the two handles (the short loop is blameless).  The traditional handle is too short for a good grip on such a big pan.  I don\\'t contest the indestructible and historically traditional shape of the iron handle - which is too hot to touch in use - requiring you to use some sort of handle sock or really tough pot holder.  The nail hole is dandy for hanging the pan (like from the buckboard of your Conestoga wagon while heading West across the prairie) - I just wish the handle were long enough to properly maneuver this big pan.Final conclusion - cast iron is a discipline.  It has certain unique strengths that are particularly well suited to fry pans and dutch ovens, for certain kinds of cooking.  I\\'m glad a I have some for that purpose.  I\\'m also glad I have some All-Clad for other more delicate cooking - and for easier day to day maintenance. I became a big fan of cast iron cookware after I got a 12\" cast iron pan about 2 years ago.  I wanted something that is perfect for making breakfast for my wife and I.  This pan is the perfect size to make a fried egg, and thanks to the pre-seasoned surface, egg doesn\\'t stick to the surface and it is very easy to clean.  Usually, I just quickly wipe the inside of the pan with some oil (using a paper towel), and nothing sticks.This is a great pan for my wife as well, its smaller size makes it trivial for her to handle (unlike our 12\" heavy pan), and it\\'s also the perfect size for her to bake some desserts in.This is a great complimentary to your cast iron cookware collection, and it\\'s got the unbeatable price at less than $10. This...this is my baby. From rib-eye, to bacon and eggs, to corn bread, this is one of my favorite items to reach for when it comes to cooking in the kitchen. If you take care of it, it will take care of you! Join the Cast Iron Master Race!!! I love this skillet, it takes me back to the time when my mother used hers.  I had always wished I had kept it.  Very easy to clean out with wet paper towell.  I used PAM on it and nothing stuck to it.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it. Great pan, preseasoned, hold heat well. I\\'ve also been ccoking steaks in the pan in the oven at high heat instead of my broiler and steaks come out great. Cleans up easy. Very heavy as it should be. Worth its weight in iron! I had never cooked with cast iron until recently when I decided to order several of Lodge\\'s skillets.  Cast iron requires a bit more maintenance (careful washing/drying and repeated seasoning) than traditional cookware but it really makes a huge difference in the taste of food.  It\\'s a lot easier to get a nice char/crust on chicken, fish, etc and the skillet surface is as non-stick as any teflon coated cookware I own.  I now use my cast iron skillets for all of my cooking and plan on buying even more of them. I love this, I cook everything with it.  I it easy to maintain, cooks great and everything I cook tastes better with it. I\\'ve decided to replace my teflon pans with cast iron and this is one of the first ones I bought. So far it has been excellent. The large size is fantastic, though it\\'s definitely heavy. My arm muscles are getting a workout! I\\'m glad I got it pre-seasoned, since that was one less thing to hassle with. I have found that cooking with cast iron makes food taste better. Kind of surprsing. I\\'m not sure why this has been the case, but my husband and I have both noticed it. I have to say though, it is very different than cooking with a regular teflon pan. At first I kept burning everything. Cast iron gets very hot and maintains a steady hot temperature. I\\'m finding that I\\'m basically cooking everything in this pan on med-low heat, where I would have used medium heat. Overall, I\\'m happy with my purchase though and plan on getting a couple more cast iron pans SAUTE, BAKE, BROIL - U NAME IT - U CAN DO IT.keep it well oiled after use - unless you want to eat rust. Good starer size (10.25\") for someone just starting out with a cast iron skillet.  Even thought it is pre-seasoned it helps to be generous with oil or shortening the first few times, and do not overheat the oil (the pan can take it but the oil cannot).  It is okay to wash with warm water and a very mild soap & brush every once in a while (which you want to do because oil can go rancid after even a short time and it will affect the pan\\'s quality).Deep enough for simply frying, but not for doing large meats or dough items. This skillet seems to be working great so far. I did have to re-season it after go it because it started to rust This is my first time using cast iron and I LOVE IT!!! I did my homework and found Lodge to be a very good brand. It\\'s made in the USA, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and easy to care for. These pans are already pre-seasoned so you only need to rub a bit of shortning on the surface after each use. I use the 8\" pan for bacon, eggs and small items and the 10\" griddle makes great pizza and pancakes.  The 12\" pan is used for bigger one pan family meals.  Food cooked in cast iron just tastes so much better than food cooked in anything else. Cast iron has a non stick surface, (when seasoned properly) heats evenly and cast iron doesn\\'t wear out with age.. it gets better. It goes from stove top to oven and you can use a variety of cooking methods from baking, broiling, frying to braising, roasting and grilling.  The recipes are endless.. it\\'s fun to cook in...go for it.. you won\\'t regret it! We got the Lodge 15\" cast iron skillet for camping trips because we have a large family.  This thing will cook a Costco package of breakfast links at once. It is a two handed job for me to pick it up, and is too heavy for my wife to even use.  We have several lodge cast iron skillets that we use on a regular basis.  Properly seasoned nothing cooks quite like cast iron. Cast Iron pans have been used for years, but I was always to wary to switch completely to cast iron from my non stick pans. Well I decided to take the plunge and order a few cast iron pans to compliment the one that i had already had and boy am i happy. They are great! Cleanup is extremely easy, and food comes out great. I recommend cast iron pans to everyone these days, and Lodge is a great and affordable brand. SOOO GOOOD.... really though this thing is awesome, good quality, nice heft, I cook everything on it. Hard to clean just because of the material but well worth making anything and everything in it. I was glad to find this very large size iron skillet.  It is perfect for fried chicken and you dont have to fry the chicken in 2 batches.  Taken care of properly.. this is the only way to fry.  Steaks are even great in this skillet.  This skillet will get hot enough and hold the heat....that is so important. Prior to  purchasing the 15 inch skillet I only had a 10 inch chicken fryer in cast iron.  I loved it but it was not large enough  to saut&eacute; or pan fry chicken, fish, etc for the size of my family without doing it in batches.  I love the size of this pan.  Although my electric, ceramic top stove does not have a burner this large, it has still done a great job due the excellent way in which cast iron conducts heat.  Wish I would have bought this years ago.  (I would prefer a gas stove, but gas is not available in my area without installing a propane tank) I was intimidated at first, but after reading others reviews purchased a 12\" and then went back to purchase a 10\".  \"The cast iron skillet cookbook\", by Sharon Kramis is great to go with this pan. (also bought on Amazon for great price)  Made a Dutch Baby and incredible porkchops! The meatloaf and roasted pototoes were the best I have ever had! 12\" is a nice size to cook for a family of 4. I bought the 10\" because some of recipes in the cookbook like the warm pear ginger upside down cake (which was great) called for a 10\".  Easy to clean too.  I bought some inexpensive nylon brushes and clean with hot water and NO SOAP.  Then I spray with vegetable oil and wipe some of the excess away with a paper towel.  It is so much fun to cook in this pan.  I can\\'t believe my mother never had one! Lodge skillets truly are one of the last great bargains in cookware. I have several pieces in the Lodge Logic line, and they make my heart sing... the non-stick patina that\\'s developed over months/years of use, the substantial heft of each piece, the rustic beauty, and most of all, that unmistakable delicious flavor that only cast iron can impart.I recently added two of these 8\" skillets to my collection. I had been eyeing them for my daily single-sized omelets (I plan to wait until the skillets are a bit more seasoned before attempting to cook eggs in them), but every day I think of countless new uses for them. They are perfect for:- a single, perfect grilled-cheese sandwich- heating up last night\\'s left-overs- sauteing baby portabella mushrooms as a side dish for dinner- skillet creme brulee or blackberry cobbler with ice cream for dinner guests - each guest gets their own perfectly-sized skillet- quesadillas- huuuuuge, perfectly-shaped sourdough pancakes, made one at a time (or two at a time if you have two of these handy skillets!)- crepes- tapas... get several of these for several types of tapas and serve right in the skillet- French toast for one- baked brie- individual-sized frittatas or quiches- skillet no-knead bread or cornbreadand so much more... I really wish I\\'d known about these when I was single. I would have eaten so much better! But, they come in so handy as junior companions to my 12\" workhorse skillet and my two-burner reversible grill/griddle, I am happy to make up lost time with these little gems.At $10 and change, I recommend you purchase as many as there are members of your family. Or if you\\'re single, buy two... so you can impress dates by serving individual-sized appetizers or dessert! Then ask for two more for Christmas, so you can add a fun, gourmet twist to your dinner parties.As with all cast iron, even though this is pre-seasoned, it\\'s a good idea to season it again yourself before using. Generally you don\\'t use soap or detergent on cast iron (and NEVER put cast iron in the dishwasher!!), but when I first get a new piece, I hand-wash it with hot water and a tiny drop of mild dish soap. Dry it thoroughly with a dish towel... then, to remove any remaining water that has been absorbed, put it on the stove or in a hot oven for a few minutes so that any remaining water will evaporate.Then, coat with a *light* coating of grapeseed oil or organic vegetable shortening. Turn the oven on 400 (or higher, if you dare!) degrees. Put your new skillet into the oven upside-down and line the bottom of the oven with aluminum foil to catch any drips. \"Bake\" for 1-2 hours. Turn the oven off, then leave the skillets in all night to cool and solidify. Your skillet will have a deeper hue and glossy sheen that it didn\\'t have when you bought it. This will make it a bit more naturally non-stick. The more you use it (or if you want, you can repeat the above seasoning process), the more non-stick it will become.With proper care, cast iron will become your most well-loved cookware. I\\'m so excited to have added two of these 8\" skillets to my Lodge cast iron collection and can\\'t wait to come up with even more uses for these adorable, super-handy little skillets! This is a must for every kitchen. Awesome for cooking authentic meals in individual serving size. Absolutely fantastic for frying eggs; nothing sticks and this will redefine the taste of your food. Extremely happy with this purchase. I am new to the whole iron pan world. So far I like it, but I was confused by the \"pre-seasoned\" information. Everyone I talked to said I should season it. So I wasn\\'t sure what to do. Also, it\\'s super heavy... and rusts easily. I knew both of these things before I bought it, but it was still a bit of a surprise. I left it to dry on my dish rack, and it rusted. i have an induction cooktop and this is perfect for  this type of cooking w/o spending a fortune on  a small pan.  i do not find the pre-seasoned coating particularly good but i wash and season my pans after each use.  not a problem for me. I like this seasoned cast iron skillet.  The only reason I gave it four star because it\\'s little heavy for me.  Item was received on time.  Packaging was good. Search on Amazon for \"Lodge Logic Boy Scouts of America Pre-Seasoned 12-Inch Skillet\"I found the same pan, pre-seasoned for much less - in my case - $13.95. Deals change all the time at Amazon so it may or may not be true when you read this but it certainly is worth checkingWhat is the difference - well there is a boy scouts logo on the bottom of the pan. Same Pan - Same Manufacturer and pre-seasoned too. It is worth a quick search.A cast iron skillet can\\'t be beat for a number of cooking chores like browning or searing. This is a great pan at a great price its a cast iron lodge product. its built so well you can personally hand this to your grand or great-grand children. they need iron in their diet. In general, cast iron RULES.  Properly seasoned and cared for, it will last for your lifetime and that of several generations after you.  Specifically, you absolutely cannot go wrong with Lodge cast iron.  It is preseasoned and ready to cook a great meal for you right out of the box.  Cast iron does require different upkeep than other cookware.  DO NOT put this in the dishwasher.  It is easy to clean while it is still hot from the stove, so a little adjustment to your cooking routine is all that is really required. Despite some of the bad experiences I\\'ve had with pre-seasoned skillets that didn\\'t have a very good seasoning on them, this one was actually pretty good.  It\\'s held up for quite a while and the seasoning (original+time added) provides better non-stick cooking than my Teflon coated pans.It also does a great job evening out the pan\\'s temperature.  Since I have an awful electric cook top, this is a must-have for me.  Finally I can cook up hand-made pirogies without having half of them burn before the other half is cooked at all. I love cast-iron. The pre-seasoned skillet makes getting into it very easy. I briefly lost the seasoning for one reason or another, but with some work I got it back and this little guy rarely leaves my stove top. It\\'s a perfect size for almost anything i need. Tried this out. Did not realize how big the 12in was, I think next time I would of stuck with the 10 inch because of the space.  This skillet does wonders and makes my steaks the way I like them amount other things I cook on this pan.  I will continue to use it and update.FYI -  it does smoke a lot, when you cook steak and all the oil is gone... good ventilation is key or you need to use this outside. I have used my skillet a number of times now. I love that it is easy to clean and it can be used on any stove top, over a fire and in the oven. The 12&#34; is huge, which means you can put a lot of food in it, but the 10&#34; might be better for smaller families. We are a family of 5 and it is still quite large. Overall it, I love it! At 12 inches across, this skillet is big! And being cast iron, it\\'s also heavy. Add to that the matching cover and it really does take two hands to handle this whopper! Note the extra handle on the front of the beast. It\\'s there for a reason. It makes the skillet manageable despite the weight.The second item to note is that this skillet is not dishwasher-safe. It requires special attention. That\\'s not unique in the world of cookware, but this one requires a little babying. I\\'ve found that the extra effort is minimal and not as mysterious as some of the reviews here have made it out to be. In short, just follow the manufacturer\\'s guidelines. They\\'re from people who know this product and they\\'re straight-forward.So with the negatives out of the way, I have to say that we love this skillet! We have cooked plenty of items in it and use it several times a week. Fried chicken, steaks, chuck roasts, you name it.For steaks, just crank up the heat to max, (we have a gas stove, so electric might be different), put a little oil, salt, and pepper on the steaks, and put them in for 3 minutes uncovered. Then flip and leave for 3 minutes. Then flip, turn off the heat, and cover for 3 minutes. Then flip and cover for 3 more minutes. That\\'s it. It\\'s all in the skillet and it comes out perfect. (adjust times for thickness of steak.) The thickness of the cast iron lets the skillet retain the heat and distribute it. With the lid on, it acts as a Dutch oven.For roasts, we start the same way, but searing the roast for 6 minutes in what Alton Brown calls a \"rocket-hot\" skillet. 3 minutes on each side, then cover it and slide it into an oven set on BROIL. Leave it there for 5 minutes/pound. (a 2-pound roast = 10 minutes.) Then turn off the oven and leave the roast for about an hour.  DON\\'T OPEN THE DOOR! Simple and delicious.About the only thing we don\\'t cook in this skillet is eggs. They do tend to stick. I have to think we\\'re doing something wrong since my in-laws cook eggs in theirs with no problems. Of course, they\\'ve had theirs since Lincoln was a toddler, and these skillets do seem to age very well, as long as you take care of them.Bottom line: If you don\\'t mind the heft and the extra bit of maintenance, this skillet will serve you well for years. And if you have kids you can inspire in the kitchen, this could become one of your treasured family heirlooms. Perfect for my needs.  I have used cast iron all my life; I grew up in a family that used cast iron.  Nothing can beat it for maintaining proper heat and keeping it that way.  I have 5 pieces of Lodge cast iron pots & skillets. I have not used the pan yet, but it appears of excellent quality.  I had trouble finding iron skillets in the store so I came to Amazon.  Great price and made in the USA! For my sister-in-law, who absolutely loves it.  I know that she will get a lot of use out of it. This pan is a great size for cooking 4 to 6 scrambled eggs or one grilled sandwich.  FYI - I recently got rid of all my Teflon cook ware and replaced it with Lodge cast iron cookware.  I love all the Lodge cookware.  The more you use it, the more seasoned it becomes and food barely sticks.  After cooking and cooling, I use a scraper and water to remove the food.  Then, I use a paper towel to dry it.  Then, to make sure it is completely dry, I heat it on the stove for about one minute.  I never use soap on the cast iron pans. made fried chicken in it and iron skillets do make things taste better and I am a very picky eater love it I\\'ve cooked so much with this skillet, I don\\'t even know where to start! Nothing sticks on this, I\\'ve deep fried stuff in this, cooked meals in this for a family of 4 and made tortillas, pizza, paninis, etc on this. The dishes are endless with this, no weird taste at all! When washing this, try to limit soap, doesn\\'t really need it unless you cooked something with color in it, just wipe it clean for the next use.. I cook a lot of Indian food so I do use a little soap to get rid of that Indian flavor but no big deal... Really good size and low maintenance, really recommend this! I debated getting a cast iron pan for some time and read the reviews of the lodge products and most seemed very satisfied. This is my first piece of Lodge cast iron but I do plan to add to my collection in the future. I\\'ve owned this cast iron skillet going on 4 years now and it\\'s just great.  I think there\\'s a bit of nostalgia and obsession brewing with some of these reviews but honestly this pan delivers and from what I\\'m told, it\\'s a healthier surface on which to cook.  Growing up my folks had cast iron skillets that were just plain abused.  I know there was soap used, I know there was steel wool used and never did I see anyone \"season\" or oil them.  I actually like taking care of this pan and I\\'ve got everyone trained, if you use it, brush it, no soap dry it and spray a fine layer of vegetable or canola oil on it and put it back in the oven.  If you\\'re a person who doesn\\'t clean pans until the next day or several days later, don\\'t bother with this pan, you\\'re too lazy to own one.This item comes pre-seasoned from the factory and let me tell you it\\'s a fine start that just improves with use and proper care.  Follow the instructions and this pan will outlive all of us.  I bought the Lodge brush when I ordered this pan and I\\'m still using that same brush, it\\'s almost time for another but it\\'s a good buy too.  Make sure you educate everyone in the household on the care required for this pan.  It\\'s worth the effort, it\\'s not a big deal, they clean up easily.  It\\'s fun to use and it heats your food like no other surface.  My favorite thing to cook is simple breakfast potatoes, it browns them well and I use a lid from another pan set that fits perfectly.  I did see some people complain of the pan cracking in half and that should be considered a factory blemish.  If this were to happen to me, I\\'d return it for another one and chalk it off as a lemon.  My skillet has served me well and I\\'m going to buy a smaller one and eventually replace all teflon surfaces with cast iron.  Although I don\\'t think I\\'m quite ready to fry an egg properly, I will figure out a way without having to use nine cubes of butter. ;-)One thing to be aware of is the way cast-iron reacts with garlic and vinegar.  I was sauteing garlic one day and somewhere during the recipe I dashed in a little rice wine vinegar and my garlic turned blue.  It wasn\\'t the most appealing color as it reminded me of food-gone-bad but I read later its a natural reaction between the iron surface, the sulphur in the garlic and the vinegar.If you buy this pan, consider the slip-on handle pad and definitely buy the stiff brush from Lodge. My nieces husband got this for Christmas to go with the scrapers and CST iron fry pan.  It works great. I do love this. I use it for almost everything I cook. It works wonderfully. No complaints. Just make sure to keep it seasoned so nothing sticks This is a true cast iron skillet.  It has a nice weight to it, heats evenly and cooks food to perfection.  The seasoning added at the factory has something to be desired, but I never really expected to last longer than it would take for the pan to naturally season while cooking.  I never dip it in water or use soap.  I scrap the food particles with a metal spatula that I used to cook with.  Wipe with a paper towel and add a light layer of oil, no more than a tablespoon. I store mine in the oven.  I have the silicone handle which helps prevent burns.  The handle does still get warn so be careful when using this skillet. I am sure with the high quality of cast iron this skillet is made from, I can hand this down to my daughter. I highly recommend this product - - you can\\'t beat the value!  And it\\'s a preseasoned pan - what a deal time saver!  I would definitely recommend buying this product from Amazon again - especially with the free shipping if you hit $25 because it is very heavy! It is required that I type so many words here but all I really wanted to say is , I love it.  My food tastes better especially my steaks because I can put the cast iron in the broiler.  Also because the cast iron allows for the meat to be evenly cooked throught out the entire pan no matter where the heat source is.  These are the kind of pans you pass on to your children.  This will last a life time. Worth every penny. And ... its American made. Bonus I have never owned or used a cast iron skillet. My mom never owned one, and I have never seen my friends using one, so I never bought one, but I have been watching the Pioneer Woman a lot on TV, and she uses them often, so I bought this one. It seems to be a great deal with the silicone handle cover. They sell some Lodge skillets like this at Walmart, but when I got this one today and lifted it, I knew those at Walmart are made to be lighter. This is one heavy pan! it must be like, 8 pounds or more! I can\\'t hold it straight with one hand, so it\\'s good it has the adjacent handle. I used it tonight and I already like how it cooks. We have several of these pans from Lodge in varying sizes.  They are all just perfect.  Made in USA - perfect quality.  Fast shipping, exactly as advertised. This is the first cast iron skillet I\\'ve bought; the last one I had was a hand-me-down. These skillets can really last a very long time if properly cared for! In my case it was time to upgrade to a larger size to accommodate my family. This pan is a very nice size and the only downside to that is that it\\'s difficult for me to lift it in/out of the oven one handed like I used to do with my old skillet. I use this primarily to make pan-seared steak, and it works perfectly for that purpose!I would definitely recommend this product! I love cooking with cast iron (wish I still had all my mom\\'s old pans...) and starting to rebuild my collection.Wanted something larger that what I had so I got this 12&#34; - and it is bigger than I thought! Love using it for &#34;range to oven&#34; recipes.Would also make a great deep dish pizza pan, thought I prefer my 17&#34; cast iron pan for that :)Lodge makes great products that will last a lifetime with the proper care. It\\'s a monster and it\\'s not even their biggest pan.  The only trouble I have ever had with cast iron cookware is getting the seasoning right.  Once that\\'s been taken care of though, this thing really cooks.  My goodness I love this pan.  The only funny thing with this pan, as compared to all the others I have from Lodge is the bottom is slightly convex so oils and fats tend to collect at the edges of the pan.  Also, take care that this pan is not to big for you.  Your flame (or other heat source) should be about the size of the bottom of the pan.  My flame does not cover such a large area so the edges of the pan are not as hot as the center.  That\\'s a problem if you\\'re just cooking four eggs.  It gets tricky.  However, if you have a lot of material in there, what a great way to deal with it.  Lodge is made in the U.S.A. and is the best quality cast iron cookware made.  Consistency of material thickness, quality of manufacture and materials, all top notch.  If you like cast iron, and I really do (I really don\\'t like eating Teflon) this is an outstanding pan for an outstanding price.  No, I don\\'t get any money from Lodge or anyone else, I\\'m just a really happy customer of Lodge cookware. I cook everything on this from breakfast foods on the burner to pizzas in the oven. Once you get this seasoned it is about the most versatile tool you\\'ll have in the kitchen. I use this skillet way more than anything else in my well-supplied kitchen arsenal. It\\'s extremely versatile and cooks very nicely and evenly. For me, the benefit of cast iron is that it holds and distributed heat evenly. People have different approaches to cleaning cast iron - I personally use a brush and soap and water and just re-season the pan every so often. I personally put my pan back on the burner to dry it after washing to avoid rust. The price of Lodge cast iron can\\'t be beat, but the low price doesn\\'t mean compromised quality. I personally find the 12 inch size to be perfect for regular use as well, although I wouldn\\'t mind a few in other sizes as well. I used to think that the best cookware is anodized aluminum Calphalon with the most advanced non-stick surface.  Well, there still is a place for those expen$ive pans, but old-fashioned cast-iron cookware is now my favorite.I already had the 12\" skillet and the rectangular grill pan, and decided to get this one because it\\'s only [...], even though the 12\" pan would probably do what this one would.  Well, for the price, I like having this size -- I cook for one and it\\'s perfect for 2 pork chops.  To give you an idea of size, two pork chops fit perfectly in the pan, and 3 pork chops make it very crowded.Cast iron is as non-stick as it needs to be.  Chicken breasts, steaks, burgers, chops all turn out well when cooked in this pan because the pan holds its heat and sears in the juices.  That is what I use it for.  For eggs, and french toast, and pancakes I go to the Calphalon non-stick.Cleanup is a breeze.  I put water into the pan after cooking (after it has cooled down a bit), eat my meal, and then use a scouring pad without soap to clean the pan.  Then I heat the pan up a bit, put a small amount of oil in the pan when it is dry and hot and wipe it around with a paper towel, leaving a very thin coating of oil.For the price, [...], you can\\'t go wrong -- if you are cooking for more than one though I recommend the 12\" pan. Size: 6-1/2\" skilletThis skillet is the reason your mother saved the bacon drippings! This versatile 6-1/2\" cast-iron skillet is for smaller cooking tasks, perfect for two eggs or bacon fried potatoes for one serving. Pre-seasoned with a vegetable oil formula and ready for immediate use... Re-season with Crisco shortening if you must. Cast-iron construction heats slowly and evenly, keeps heat longer, use on low/med heat setting. Do not put in dishwasher! Just wipe out with moist towel. Measures 1-1/2 inches deep and has a lifetime Lodge warranty! Wonderful Product just as described, never use the other pans I have!This will be given to future generations of the family to use. Really enjoying this pan for browning, searing foods, especially chopped onions.  Bought this pan specifically for cooking scallops and it has not disappointed. I absolutely love this pan!  The 12 inch is a perfect size.  I use it more than any other pan I own (an I own many!).  The more you use it, the better it gets.  Keep it oiled after each use and it will stay beautiful.  I highly recommend this product! I cook for myself, so this little skillet is the perfect size for 3-egg omelet in the morning, or veggie saute for dinner. I am a small to medium sized female w/ skinny arms, but this skillet is not too heavy so I can still lift it w/ one arm. It\\'s not really non-stick because the eggs won\\'t easily slide off the pan like they would from a good new non-stick pan, but it\\'s much much better compared w/ my stainless steel skillets. As long as you soak the pan in water after cooking, by the time you finish your meal, the food residue can be easily washed off with a brush or sponge. I use a nylon dish brush with hot water and cleaning is very fast and easy. I never use soap or steel wool. Leaving a bit grease on acts like re-seasoning. This is the same way I take care of my carbon-steel wok. The only complaint I have is that the handle is way too short. The skillet is relatively heavy but even with my small hands it still feels as if the handle only fits half of my palm, so it forces your hand to hold it really close to the hot pan - really bad design. Though I use it everyday and find it indispensable, the short handle alone is why I am unwilling to give it a five star rating. This was a replacement of a 20&#34; I ordered that wouldn\\'t fit in my oven for making cornbread and Fretotas . It has turned into a multi use pan and I love it This was my first cast iron skillet.  Decided to try cast iron in an attempt to get away from Teflon.  I have to say I didn\\'t understand cast iron before.  I was worried about rust and cleaning.  Lodge does a good job of explaining cleaning and maintenance.  I am now hooked on cast iron and love this 12\" skillet and the 8\" skillet.  I use this one for meat and the 8\" for eggs and grill cheese.  I didn\\'t love the pre-seasoning.  The first few times after cleaning black keeps rubbing off.  Now after many uses this piece has a nice finish that I just love.  Still giving 5 stars because overall this is a great product I would not want to be without now. I picked this skillet up as a gift for my fiance and we both just love it! The weekend I gave it to him we were off camping and took it with us... we cooked everything that weekend in it. We use this skillet now more than any other pan in the house.We both love this cast iron skillet. This is a great iron skillet and the perfect size. I\\'ll be using for a long time to come. Would reccomend. ...first off dont even attempt to fry eggsin this skillet for at least 2 weeks of using....when i recived mine i washed well in hot water, even tho it seasoned your gonna wanna do it theright way...after washing put on top stove to dry,then cooked bacon in it, you are gonna wanna useanimal fat as much as possiable.....it did stick but thats toobe expected with first time use, then i towel dryedthe extra grease and added lard....put in oven at 500degrees, expect some smoking, just have fans ready, for1 hr...turn oven off, i did this like 3-4 times...thencooked fried potatoes with onions ,worked great, friedan egg and it slid off pan...great pan, just got dutch oven too... This is the skillet to have on a number of fronts. The extra handle makes for both easier and safer handling. The pouring spout assists in draining excess liquid or oil, and allows for venting yet minimizes spillovers, if covered with a lid. I prepare a lot of stir-fry requiring even cooking at high temperatures, and have not needed a wok. And I couldn\\'t make my crispy bacon skillet bread without cast iron. So, for versatility and reliability with extra details, this is the skillet to beat! My brother is a big cast iron fan, he has two Lodge cast iron pans which he has owned for years.So I decided to get one, since he would always make great steaks, chops, omelettes, and potato\\'s in his.My new pan (I got the 12 inch) arrived quickly and safely packaged. These ones from Lodge are pre-seasoned, so you\\'re ready to go as soon as it arrives. Some people like to do an extra seasoning coat anyways, but I didnt bother and it made no difference.My first attempt was to fry a ribeye by pan frying it quickly on each side and then puting it in a high temp oven for a few minutes to finish it (for the recipe I used Google - Alton Brown\\'s cast iron ribeye recipe). It came out GREAT. While my steak was resting, I quickly scrubbed my pan with some warm water and salt. (no soap) I was susprised how easily the gunk came off just with scrubbing some gritty sea salt and water. I have a separate sponge which I have now dedicated to be my &#34;no-soap&#34; sponge... I then oiled it a bit after cleaning but before putting it away.My 2nd attempt was some quartered red bliss potato\\'s which I baked in the pan at 500 degrees with just oil salt and pepper. They also came out great. Again, I scrubbed and re-oiled my pan while it was still warm.Im pleased with how easy it is to clean, and how mine has already turned black and shiny, and non-stick.The trick is to follow the care guidelines, these things rock.I think I might get a 2nd one so I can do steaks/chops and sides at the same time.5 Stars. Cast iron skillet with a &#34;Cool&#34; handle.  if you like to cook like we do, ya just gotta have one of these and it\\'s pre-seasoned so you don\\'t have to do that part of a new cast iron skillet.  This is a great piece of cooking gear for our kitchen.  If you like to cook.............. I got this to use on my induction cooktop.  It\\'s small but enough for about 3 fried eggs or one grilled cheese at a time.It came pre-seasoned but it looked like it needed a bit more work so I oiled it up and put it in a hot oven, which I then turned off but left shut and the next morning the little pan was ready to go.It cooked well and washed up well after that.  I like the little loops on the Lodge Logic pans, I hang them over my wood stove when not in use and they look very nice. This skillet is too large to use on my indoor stove.  I bought it for outdoor and oven use.  I was very happy to find that a 13 pound turkey fit in this skillet to roast!  I\\'ve also used it to make homemade tortilla chips, a large pan pizza, a huge batch of chex mix, and baked ziti! I use this for 2-4 eggs over easy. Usually a dap of coconut oil for lube and low heat and the even distribution makes easy work of it. Whites are fork tenter if not over cooked or cooked too hot. Perfect. I bought two of these in February to make individual pies in, but since then I have found many other uses for them.  They may be just a tad big for individual servings, but the presentation is fabulous! So far I have made pies, breakfast (potatoes & eggs), and even shepherds pie in these and each time everything comes out perfect! You really cannot beat how a cast iron product cooks food. Non-stick, easy to clean... The only drawback for this item is it\\'s weight. But I guess it goes with the material you buy! :) Also, it being 8\" in diameter, it does not have the 2nd handle to grab on to while moving it. Hence it only gives you the option to hold it with one hand. The handle does get super hot, so you need mittens to hold the pan handle. But the food that is cooked it it tastes incredible! So, all in all, it\\'s a great pan to have! I love this pan. Using it every day. Please note that it is very heavy. Even though it is pre-seasoned, i would recommend to pre-season it yourself with flax oil before using it. We decided to switch back to cast iron after having burnt or scratched too many teflon or silverstone type pans. The more I read, the more I am convinced that cooking with these synthetic pans may be dangerous to health.I used cast iron for years and only quit because I heard it destroys vitamin c. Well, better to destroy vitamin c than to cause cancer from fumes of god-knows-what coming out of synthetically coated pans! Vitamin C is cheap and we take quite a bit of it every day anyway.The one drawback of this pan is that it is SUPER HEAVY! Wow! My wife needs two hands to move it from the counter to the stove! Unless you need one this big I might suggest a smaller one, maybe 10&#34;.What I love about this pan is that it is pre-conditioned. The last cast iron pan I bought (which is a smaller one), I had to condition it myself and it took time and effort. It\\'s not difficult but it does take time. For the money I think this is a better deal and I used it right out of the box (after washing it with mild soap and drying it). It worked great as I knew it would - cast iron is cast iron, as far as I know - that is, any cast iron will give you about the same results if it is made well. This one is made well.Again if you need one this big, go for it! If not, get a smaller one. What I like about the big one is that it can be used for smaller things, whereas a small one cannot be used for bigger things.One thing I\\'d like to see is an option to get it shipped with a fitted leather or silicone handle pad as if you cook on higher heat for a while the handle WILL GET HOT. I do have a handle pad somewhere, that I used with my old (smaller) cast iron pan, I just have to find it. But it would be nice to have a fitted silicone handle. Does anyone make one? I\\'ll have to check.But ALL cast iron pan handles get hot and I suggest you buy a handle pad and get in the habit of using it. Otherwise, grabbing a hot handle once or twice will teach you the hard way to use one! I bought one of these pans to replace my non-stick fry pan. Im really satisfied with my purchase. just beware of the different method of cleaning for these iron skillets or an iron cook items. taken good care of, I can see this pan lasting me a lifetime of daily use. one recommendation I\\'d like to make to new buyers is to get a strong heat resistant handle cover. I didn\\'t expect it to be that big, I think a 10in skillet would have been better but this is great for making lunch/dinner. I fried porkchops last weekend and they were evenly browned! I never get that from my normal skillets.It is heavy and always careful not to drop it, I\\'m ok if it breaks but I am afraid of losing my toes haha..good thing it has a handle!Cleaning is a breeze too! I clean it with soap and sponge then completely dry it, that spray it with PAM then wipe the excess oil off and heat it for a while and then store. I love it! This is now my go to fry pan. I got rid of all my teflon pans. It is a bit heavy and don\\'t think you could flip food, but it cooks food faster than my other pans. It browns and cooks meat extremely well. Eggs never tasted better. And bacon....oh, bacon is crispy to my liking. Just remember to season this pan after use. I would buy another Lodge cast iron pan again. Lately I\\'ve been doing a lot of cooking. One of the things I love to do is to make an entire meal in a skillet. That means I\\'m just dumping things in at different stages, sometimes requiring me to toss it in the oven. This cast iron skillet is perfect for that. I haven\\'t tried any cast iron skillet baking, but I\\'m thinking I might make a cookie or a cake in this thing. Right now, I mostly make steak and potatoes in it. Either way, it\\'s fantastic. I\\'d recommend it. You must cook a lot of fatty food in it to start out.  Did my first skittle steaks the other night - utterly fantastic.  Took less than 8 minutes to cook, set off all the smoke alrams in the house, but it was the juiciest steak I have ever eaten in my life (medium cooked).  I still wipe it down with oil after each cooking and if I ever have the oven on, I put in there for the ride to keep somewhat seasoned.  Still not non-stick yet (unless a lot of greese in the pan) so I hope it will work  soon! Like another reviewer has already said, what do you expect when the description said miniature skillet?  The price should have been a dead giveaway and it almost is.  A really great price for great quality.  I scramble 1 to 2 eggs depending on the size egg I happen to have on hand and cover the skillet with a saucer or salad plate to styeam the egg till solid.  With a little ham, a sausage patty, or two strips of cut up bacon and a slice of cheese, one can enjoy a better sandwich than can be found at the local hamburger place.  I just don\\'t understand any complaints about this great deal. I\\'m sure I will find many additional uses. Arrived on time, well packagedIs as describedThis is one HEAVY skillet! so be prepared to deal with the weightThat aside, it will be just what you need to fry chicken, deep enough and the heat will be well distributedIf you already have the Dutch oven, you have a lid that will fit this skillet. These pans are great if you take care of them. The only reasonable complaint I\\'ve seen posted that doesn\\'t apply to broken pans or other such one-time issues is that the cooking surface is much more pitted than older pans. This is not the biggest deal, frankly, and it will become less apparent the longer you cook with it and season it, but if you hate it and are not afraid to use power tools on it, just grind down the cooking surface and re-season. It only takes  a couple of minutes (other than the re-seasoning) and will be the only difference between this pan and a very expensive cast iron pan put out by other brands in the fancier stores. I just bought this skillet this weekend and have already used it three times.  I love this product!  Probably the best kitchen product I have ever bought.  The best part is it comes with handy directions so you won\\'t mess up your pot. I purchased this on amazon SIX years ago.It has a little bit of rust, but its still going strong. One of my fave pans by far. Great for cooking meats and vegetables. Easy enough just to wipe it off when I\\'m done with it, then I rinse and scrub it without soap in hot water right before I use it again (I use it a lot) so I don\\'t have to worry about rust between uses. Great price for something that will last forever, gives food amazing flavor, browns things to perfection. Love. this. skillet. This is a great preseasoned cast iron skillet.  Good quality, 5 star.I look forward to using the other sizes. This is the quintessential cast iron pan everyone should own. Lodge has excellent quality, and this is the perfect size to start with.I would avoid cheaper cast iron as they tend to be irregularly formed and heat differently across the pan, which can ruin what you\\'re cooking. Anything more expensive isn\\'t worth it at all.I have since expanded my collection of Lodge products and am totally satisfied. I was raised by a dinner-from-the-box type of family, so cooking with cast iron was an entirely new concept for me. I do remember one of my grandparents cooking from one when I would visit, but didn\\'t give it much thought. We recently just restocked our kitchen, from plates and flatware to non-stick pans. I decided to buy the Lodge 8\", 10 1/4\" and 6 1/2\" skillets along with the 10.5\" griddle about 10 days ago. So far, I love them all, though I use the 8-inch version the most. In fact, I find myself using these far more than the non-stick skillets we purchased around the same time.I\\'ve had no problems with rusting due to following instructions, which is always important. The more I use it, the better the food tastes. I also made an attempt to watch some how-to videos off YouTube, which helped tremendously as well (Alton Brown has some handy ones on there).When I first used these, food did stick quite a bit, despite using oil, so I decided to start applying oil after each use. I now am in the habit of rinsing/scrubbing when I\\'m done, I dry it down and then heat it back up on the stove as I apply a thin layer vegetable-based oil, which seems to make it more non-stick. Not a must-do sort of thing, since it\\'s already pre-seasoned, but I\\'m loving the results. I don\\'t do it long, just about a two minutes. It also helps me to ensure that everything\\'s dry. I just received this skillet today....did a quick wash with plain hot water, dried it, put it on stove...then proceeded to fry up a catfish dinner! In a word, AWESOME! Fried like a dream and cleaned up in a few quick minutes.  I also just bought the double dutch oven and the 3 qt. Combo Cooker.... and the Lodge Cookbook, course!  Spent the last hour cleaning out my cupboards and I filled up my trash can tonight with 3 yr old &#34;green fry pans&#34; that performed lousy and a chipped, rusted and cracked enamel-lined-cheap-China-knockoff dutch oven.  Good riddance! This great Lodge skillet has a new home on the back burner of my stove. The other 2 Lodge beauties are washed, oiled up and ready for tomorrow\\'s pot roast. I am now an Official Grandma with her heirloom skillets and pots in tow! Now I just gotta put them in my will so there won\\'t be any fights! ))))grins. Great product. What can you say about a Lodge pan. It\\'s big heavy cooks great last forever what else could you ask for. I used it a couple of times and it seems OK. Make sure you want a big, heavy skillet before you order this one. We gave away our older set of cast iron ware when we decided to lighten our kitchen utensils for camping.  Bad mistake.  We bought a set from Wal-Mart which were just plain terrible.  Nothing beats a real cast iron skillet from Lodge.  It is no small wonder why they are so popular.  We did appreciate the extra loop handle for added security when moving the pan.  Makes one feel more comfortable about using on a glass smooth top stove. I like cooking with cast iron and this is not a let down.  Great product and arrived on time. Will order Still learning how to cook with it - but I\\'m happy with it - my husband said it made the best sauteed chicken he has ever had.  I do get stuff burned on (not like my non-stick pans) - but it cleans pretty easily. What a really great skillet.  Makes the best fried Southern Chicken I have ever done and get great reviews from friends who have shared the meal with me.  I am convinced that this is a great product and that\\'s the reason why the chicken comes out so good.  Thanks. Gee....all things seem to come back in style and this is a great example of one that should. Well seasoned, I put a little oil in it, let it heat up and made a whole breakfast from potatoes, grilled tomatoes and of course eggs. It worked great, no sticking, potatoes turned nice and brown, eggs perfect all on medium heat.Then the test.....clean up. Took a damp dish rag and wiped it out, No muss no fuss. Added a little oil to coat it again while still warm and it was ready for the next breakfast. Now 40 breakfasts later....each better than the next.I just love it and do not have to worry about non-stick coating health hazards.Just to show you new is not always better. With proper care this should last a lifetime or three.Do your self a favor and get one. Great price and value. Just remember do as the direction state, Do not wash in the dishwater or soak in the sink. Clean immediately after cooking and just coat with a little oil for the next one. This is good quality and will be a pan that I use for a very LONG time to come. Anyone interested in buying quality cast iron cookware should consider this company. This is a fairly small skillet, 8 inch, which is the right size for some things.  The sides are fairly tall for a small skillet (1.75 inch by my measurement, inside measurement), which I consider to be a good thing.  This is pre-seasoned and is ready to use right out of the box.  As far as cooking performance, it\\'s cast iron so it\\'s great.  Use it on the stove or in the oven or on the BBQ grill, it\\'s a very versatile material.  And the Lodge Logic is extremely economically  priced.  I also like that a cast iron lid is available for this pan.  The lid doesn\\'t cover the little space made by the indents for the pour spouts, which may be a good thing in some applications but not so good in other applications (sometimes you might want a little venting with the lid on).  But if you need it un-vented a piece of foil should do the job. I hesitated many years to buy cast Iron.  I dreaded the maintenance.  This skillet is  a perfect size for my family.  It is large enough to cook most things I make and light enough to lift easily.  I also have a dutch oven and cornstick pans.  I did  not buy a cast iron lid for this--prefer the Lodge tempered glass lid for use on top of the stove.  There are only 2 of us now most of the time.  It never sticks; I seasoned it at 450 degrees for three hours although it was preseasoned from Amazon.  It never sticks, no rust and used daily.  It is the perfect size for pineaple upsidedown cake. I do not use soap, run hot water in it after cooking and clean it  with warm water and the Lodge scrubber brush.  Always rub a little oil on it, and stick it in the oven a few minutes before I put it away. I love this pan!!!I use this for broiling & roasting food in the oven, for roasting seeds and flour on the stove, and for normal stove top uses.  I love the size! I can fit so much in it and keep things from getting crowded.  It is HEAVY, but I just keep it in the bottom drawer of my oven.SEASONING AND CLEANING:Before using it the first time I did a quick \\'seasoning\\' technique I learned from my wok: take green onion ends, chopped up and saute them rubbing them around the pan \\'till they\\'re burned.For cleaning, I just use hot water and a scrub brush... NO soap!, NO soaking, quick dry. We use this pan every single day.  It makes great scrambled eggs and frittatas.  We also use it for other everyday cooking and some baking.  Great price and quality.  I also bought a HUGE version of this pan for when we have company and are cooking a higher volume of food.  This has a permanent place on our stove top. I bought these to make Dutch pancakes and these do a wonderful job. My only suggestion is follow the care instruction as they do rust quite easily. I needed something small and easy to handle for a small portion I cook nightly.  This skillet was the perfect size.  The only downside was not having a lid but I use a silicone lid and they work perfectly together. I bought this skillet and the lid for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them both!  She says they are high quality and she can now cook all of her pork chops at one time! About the only thing I wish this skillet had was a longer handle which is why I gave it four instead of five stars. As I recall, cast iron skillets used to have longer handles. Other than that, it is great. It will never break as so much modern &#34;high-quality&#34; cookware is apt to do these days. I used it this morning to fry eggs. It worked great. It was easy to clean. Very glad to have purchased this high quality skillet. Best of all, it\\'s made in the USA. This skillet is fantastic! It\\'s huge! We needed a larger cast iron skillet and this is perfect. Can\\'t beat that it\\'s made in the USA - it had the little card stating this, and I\\'ve noticed people ask this question on other cast iron products so I thought I\\'d mention it here just in case this interests you. This pan should work great in our large Big Green Egg ... mostly as a drip pan under a goose or roast... but also for cooking.  With the long handle it won\\'t fit in the BGE... No problem, I just cut the long handle off with a side grinder. This is my second pan by Lodge, I have a larger one.  I cannot believe it took me so many years to discover the utter joy of cooking with cast iron - I have gotten rid of all my other pans.  Cast iron has changed my life and my cooking habits - and the Lodge pans are a wonderful quality.  Love the smaller size for making single serving fritattas and such. I can\\'t believe I threw away one of these pans 20 years ago!  I have used my new lodge skillet a couple of times and so far love it!  I am tired of teflon pans warping and continually buying new ones.  Hopefully these will become my new go to skillets...so far, so good! You will enjoy this skillet, a lot! The Lodge company manufactures cookware which is non-stick, NO chemical coating, pre-seasoned, *MADE IN THE USA*. Couldn\\'t find a 15\" Lodge lid, but I had another manufacturer\\'s lid which happened to fit. Easy to clean...hot water (no soap), plastic brush & dry very well. Oil it occasionally. Use oven mitts. Store it in the oven, as you will use it frequently. This 15\" skillet easily fit 12 chicken thighs, browned and then baked with lots of vegetables and sauce. Plan to gradually transition to all Lodge cookware, for reasons of excellent quality & value, safe & healthy cooking...and buying American-Made. I love this Cast Iron Skillet! I just love it! Been cooking with it non-stop, since I received it in the mail. It cooks and bakes really well. Also I\\'ve been following instructions on how to clean it well without ruining it on lodgemfg.com. When done washing with hot water (I make sure I use rubber gloves, so you don\\'t get burn!) I dry it with a dish cloth or paper towels and spray some Pam on it, butter flavor! I love my Lodge Cast Iron cookware. Some of it is more than forty years old, and still going strong.The 4 star rating is for the write-up.When I needed a 12-inch cooking surface for adapting some recipes to cast iron, I had a D\\'oh Moment. I ordered a 12-inch skillet. But, nope. While the Product Details state the size as 13 inches (which it is on the outside), the 12 inches is the lid size. The cooking surface is considerably smaller.I\\'d like to see more information in the Product Details.And, I\\'ll be buying the 15-inch skillet. &lt;sigh> I grew up using cast iron skillets and my family members all have them so I suddenly realized it was weird that I\\'d never bought one for myself!  (I think I\\'ve been using my enamel dutch oven for a lot of things.)  This one said it came pre-seasoned which meant something different than I was envisioning.  My family\\'s old seasoned skillet has a tight, smooth surface that we maintain with oil so that\\'s what I imagined it would be like but it is actually sort of bumpy on its surface which is strange to me.  Anyway, it cooks just fine so it\\'s all good but yeah, not quite like ma\\'s. Pro: Product quality is exceptional!! We finally purchased our first pan! Con: It\\'s wayyyy tooo big. I need to hold it with two hands and that\\'s w/o food in it. I would only recommend this to families that have more than 5 mouths to feed.  B/c the pan is so large, the heat distribution doesn\\'t work well on a normal stove, so it gets really hot in the center but not enough heat on the side.  It probably would much better on a bbq or outdoor grill. I can\\'t wait to purchase the more \"feed couple only\" 10\" one! I have always liked Lodge cast iron. There are some cooking tasks that even our pricey All-Clad cookware can\\'t do as well as cast iron can. The only thing I regret, is that the handle is quite short. This is good for fitting the skillet in the oven or inside the bbq grill cover, but not good for leverage to lift the pan. Use two oven mitts, and grab it at both sides. Should be a basic issue item for every kitchen.  The iron skillet is what your grandparents and their parents cooked with every day.Technology has yet to duplicate the results obtained from this simple and inexpensive item.  No other cookware can do eggs on the range, fried chicken on the BBQ grill, fajitas on an open pit fire and bake a potatoe casserole in the oven.The perfect gift for young families just getting started.  If nothing else, it may save them from spending thousands of dollars chasing the \"perfect\" skillet. I love this pan.  It is very very easy to clean.  Well worth the money!  It is a bit on the heavy side but to me it is the end results that count.... I started out reading all the 1 STAR reviews ( as we all do). And what I saw, was a disconnect with the familiarity of CAST IRON. Especially non-enameled cast iron. First and foremost, yes the IRON quality is a little lower than 25 -100 years ago. But as is EVERYTHING, on earth. So let\\'s accept this fact and move on.The pan is good for egg frying, sautes, veggie sears, and CORNBREAD. It makes a family of 4-6 size portions of sides, breads, etc.  The prices with PRIME SHIPPING is excellent.My pan arrived in Mint condition.PLEASE RE-SEASON before use, and take care of this pan, as ALL CAST IRON.  Again the 1-star gang, are all newbies and not skilled with using CAST IRON, so their reviews are based on their ignorance. So ignore THEM.Here is my tip, and please follow, and you will fall in love with CAST IRON, and I hope you buy the 2 next sizes up, and pass this down to your children and grandchildren, because YES, Lodge  with proper care, should last your lifetime, and a couple more.LOLITA\\'S LODGE CARE TIP:I think this skillet is fine, if you season it yourself with VEGETABLE SHORTENING.  Pre-heat oven to 350, and apply a thick- EVEN- coat of shortening, with white paper towel, folded in half ( so it does not break up).  all over the pan, inside and out, and place on cookie sheet, face down, and let the pan bake for 1 FULL hour.  Remove from oven, for 10 minutes, and repeat the process 2 more times. Then let final cool down, and wash with rag, a a little dish soap, OR USE A MILD SCRUB BRUSH ( NYLON, NOT COPPER) ( no scrubbing, or immersion), just simple sink wash, and NEVER  put CAST IRON, that is NOT enameled, in dishwasher.  Lodge is still better than most foreign imports. However, it\\'s not the lodge of the 1920\\'s-90\\'s. I mean many of the pans are not even BLACK. But it\\'s still a good price, and cost per use over a lifetime. Just needs a little more care than our Grandma\\'s Lodge.AND PLEASE DRY IMMEDIATELY, WITH A TOWEL. All cast iron hates to sit in water. Combined with glass lid (Amazon suggested lid making my getting a good fit an easy process), this produces consitand results on foods that I would otherwise grill.  I cook on a old Jenn Aire 2 bunrer electric range with a downdraft which I absolutely hate.  But this pan and lid produces awesome results after enduring the several minutes it takes for the burner to heat up.  See my review of the lid fo more detail.Cleaning tip.  After remove food, move pan to cool burner, pour about half ounce of water in pan, scrape all remaining food loose with metal spatula,  remove water and most grime with one r 2 circular wipes with 2-3 sheets of paper towel (not touching pan with yourfingers so that you do not get burned, 1-2 circularwipes with clean paper towel to remove all rime and &#34;polish&#34; te pan.  As necessary, add about teaspoon of olive oil or equvilent to pan and rub into pan surface with paper towel (clean rag would be better) in order to keep pan &#34;seasoned&#34;. I bought this as a gift and it was well received.  My friend had talked about wanting a cast iron pan for ages and she was thrilled when she opened the box.  She was even more pleased that it was a Lodge.  I have an older version of the same pan.  My pan does not have the aide at the other side of the pan but it seems to be a great addition. The Lodge LMS3 Mini Skillet (3.5&#34;) is perfect for one egg. My husband prefers his breakfast sandwich NOT have egg hanging over the edges of the english muffin (silly, I know, but it\\'s the truth) and this pan makes the perfectly sized egg. I allow it to cook a bit more than usual on the first side so it stays together when flipped with a mini spatula and voila, a perfectly sized fried egg for one perfectly sized egg sandwich.It is supposed to arrive pre-seasoned, but like all cast iron cookware, it works best now that I\\'ve seasoned it myself. Also like all cast iron cookware, it WILL rust if left wet. Best to simply wipe out the skillet after each use and if you feel you MUST wash it, best to dry it immediately.Cheers!=^..^= I can\\'t say enough good things about the pre-seasoned cast iron.  It is especially helpful to people who are new to using cast iron.  This is a big skillet and the only drawback is the weight, it is VERY heavy.  Once you get used to using cast iron and find out how it retains heat and cooks great, you will love it.  I find that cleanup is easy too.  After you are done cooking (while it is still hot), fill it half full with water and leave it on the still warm burner &amp; the food will basically cook itself off.  If necessary use a brush to loosen anything left on the pan, rinse with hot water (do NOT use soap)and dry.  While the pan is still warm from the hot water, smooth a thin layer of shortening over it and wipe off excess with a paper towel.  If the pan is still too hot to use my fingers, I use a small toothbrush and rub the shortening on with it.  If you are cooking for less than four people, buy the smaller size skillet. We are becoming more and more aware of the foods we eat that also includes the types of materials and containers our foods are packaged in.  I have long heard about the negative effects of using teflon coated pans.  From the internet research and googling information on cast iron skillets, I have decided that the Lodge Logic brand was best for us for these reasons:1: Made in USA2: Price3: Quality4. Alton Brown uses Lodge cast iron products5. Pre-seasonedAccording to the enclosed label that accompanied this product, that use of oil may be necessary for the first couple of times to prevent food from sticking.  Food did stick once or twice in the beginning.However, after getting acclimated to this skillet it\\'s really easy cleaning it each and every time.  Sometimes I just have to wipe it clean with a paper towel and sometimes I just use soap and water, wipe quickly and just &#34;season&#34; it for next time.  I am continuing to add more cast-iron products in my kitchen as I replace the teflon products. This is the bad boy of all bad boys.Deep enough to fry up fish/chicken/chops/etc, yet large enough for sausage, bacon, or eggs.It\\'s very well constructed, and will last a lifetime with proper cast iron care.The more you use it, the better things taste. If you want cast iron, you can\\'t go wrong with this skillet. Perfect size for cooking for one - use the 10\" for two. Note that glue from the label leaves a slight discoloration on the skillet - probably nothing, but I cooked it quite a few times to scrub it out. I often make skillet cornbread as a go-to for hearty winter meals and this skillet is the perfect size!The small size makes the perfect portion for a one-meal accompaniment - no leftovers!  Yay! These pans are perfect for making Vietnamese sizzling  crepes (banh xeo).  They are on the heavy side, however.  My wrist would get tired after making about 16 to 20 crepes. With these pans, each crepe would turn out perfectly crispy.  These pans for forgiving because the thick and heavy size, which evens out the heat.  I also use these to make lamb shanks and other dishes.  A matching lid makes it even more versatile.  I can\\'t understand why people would pay so much money for Teflon-coated pans when seasoned cast iron cookwares are just as non-sticking and are so much less expensive.  These pans will probably out live me.UPDATE:  I got 3 of these now! Some foods must be cooked in a heavy pan that tempers and retains heat, for those foods Lodge offers this 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet.  This heavy-duty skillet is ideal for crispy strips of bacon or perfectly fried chicken.  It even performs beautifully in the oven (try skillet cornbread).  Though it must be hand washed, dried and oiled, this frying pan is an integral part of my cooking routine and is definately worth the extra care.  It\\'s on my list of most-used kitchen goods and I expect it will last a lifetime. I stopped using teflon coated pans because they don\\'t wear well, and I\\'m not thrilled with the idea of the chemicals leeching into my food. I seasoned the pan with a paper towel dampened with cooking oil, and my morning omelets don\\'t stick. I re-season the pan after 4-5 washings to maintain the patina. Just don\\'t put it in the dishwasher. If you have seasoned it, you won\\'t need steel wool or any abrasives to clean it. Easily hand wash and dry right away. I love to cook and I bought this for certain recipes and it is really wonderful. I have been using it over and over. We also used it in our barbecue and surprise it worked great, so so easy to clean. My hubby was doubtful about the barbecue now he loves it . He can have one of his favourite dishes which I could not cook because the skillet we had disappeared when we movedSo  it will last forever . . . though it MUST be here somewhere. SO I went to Amazon and bought this new one, then went to the grocers for a small bottle of vegetable one. Great for bacon and eggs, that\\'s all I\\'ve fried so far. If you can\\'t inherit your grandma\\'s skillet this is a good substitute.  The trick to cast iron skillets is to get them hot before cooking. They are the best.  I have four, in different sizes.  Yes, they are a bit heavier, yes, they are not completely non-stick, certainly at the beginning, but given that teflon is now acknowledged to produce cancer, this is a no-brainer.  Not to mention that you get added iron by just cooking in them.  Plus, the ritual of cleaning with a brush, which just takes a minute and can be done without even wetting your hands, becomes rather pleasant.One bit of advice: the first few times you use, be generous with the oil.  All you need is a film that covers all the surface--add a bit if the food absorbs it while cooking.  This way you avoid food getting stuck on the surface and causing problems with the seasoning.  THe more you use it, the better it becomes.Perfect size for two fried eggs! I have several rather old Griswold skillets which I consider to be the best around.  However, I had none in this size range; ordered the Lodge Logic skillet based on reviews and I am not disappointed.  It has performed admirably and the craftsmanship is very good.  An excellent oversized skillet for the price. This was my first experience with a Lodge pre-seasoned skillet, and having read some reviews of the Lodge pre-seasoned finish, I wasn\\'t certain I would like it. Much to my delight, it has performed beautifully, right from the get-go. It is true that the finish of these pans is not mirror-smooth like the perfectly seasoned and maintained cast iron pans of yesteryear, but that is mainly an aesthetic difference, not a practical one. In all other respects, the pans are equivalent. The surfaces of both are nearly non-stick, and the evenness of the temperature, heat-retention, and durability make them far preferable to teflon-coated non-stick pans. For searing of meat and other high-temperature cooking, there is nothing that can compare to cast iron. This size is perfect for so many uses; its quality and durability make it a bargain. I\\'ve used Calphalon and other anodized aluminum pans, Le Creuset and other enameled pans, non-stick pans of all sorts, copper, stainless steel, and on and on, and there is nothing that can surpass a properly seasoned cast iron pan. This pan should be the basis of every serious cook\\'s batterie de cuisine. I\\'m using this pan a lot instead of using the microwave or oven to reheat things. Very useful  Makes great grilled cheese sanwiches. Evenly sautes onions in prep for making other dishes I love my Lodge skillet.  Never thought it would beat cooking a steak on the outdoor barby, but I now cook my steaks no other way.  In fact, the taste and texture are the same as any of the best restaurants, including, for me, most recently, Capitol Grille, in Baltimore\\'s Inner Harbor.  The service at home wasn\\'t as good, though. This is a case of not being WYSIWYG!  I have a 12\" cast iron skillet and was looking for one a couple of inches larger.  This seemed to be what I wanted, but when it arrived I found it to be a slant-sided skillet with a cooking surface of the same old 12\" I have.  The \"Pre-Seasoning\" has been a disappointment also.  I\\'ve used this skillet many times and have to re-season it after every use, and I followed instructions when it arrived.  I have a pre-seasoned biscuit pan that has held its seasoning with no problem, so I\\'m mostly disappointed in this skillet. Excellent pan, be sure to condition it properly before you use it & continue to condition it depending on how often you use it. This pan will last a life time. this is a great pan, but beware, it is really heavy!  hard to manage by myself especially when it\\'s full I was excited to try out my new skillet.  And a little disappointed on how my burgers stuck to the pan.  I\\'m not giving up hope though as I knew this pan is new and it needs to be broken in.  I\\'ve only used it once so I can\\'t really say overall if it\\'s a great skillet or not.  No worries, I\\'m not giving up hope. This is the greatest frying pan. It\\'s much larger then I had imagined and it is the. Perfect size for preparing dishes.it really works well. This is exactly as advertised. It\\'s heavy (but not too heavy since it\\'s just a 9&#34; pan), retains heat perfectly and is pre-seasoned. I also got the hot pad handle which I think is mandatory (otherwise you might just reach out to move the hot pan and get burned). Its an iron skillet, and its was such an affordable expense! I LOVE the Lodge brand, so much so I brought another one! Great product, took a while to convince my wife to get into cast iron cooking however now that she is on board we will be switching to all cast iron. Best part it is made in America! and for steak, and anything else that fits in the small skillet.  Stop buying lousy and potentially dangerous pots and pans from China and get yourself some genuine made in America cast iron.  Yeah, it\\'s heavy.  But keep them dry with a light coating of vegetable oil ( olive oil works great ) and its better than teflon.  Same goes for the skillets.  Another plus,  it will last forever if you follow a few simple rules.  The Lodge instructions tell all.  Do your family a favor and rediscover cooking like it was always meant to be. This pan does exactly what it advertises.  The preseasoning worked well and you should treat the pan properly to keep the seasoning \"healthy.\"  The 10 1/4 inch is a good size for many things and fits well on a large burner.  Keep in mind if you go bigger the pan will be that much heavier.I use the pan for making Swedish pancakes, and cast iron is the only type of pan you will find an authentic Swedish pancake cooking in.  When you get your pan, google a Swedish pancake recipe and give them a try.  Much thinner than the traditional pancake.The only thing I don\\'t like about the pan is that it didn\\'t come with a handle insulator.  I realize it is clearly advertised and doesn\\'t claim to have a handle insulator, so I am still giving the product 5 stars.  I just wish Lodge Logic would include an insulator, even if they have to jack up the price a couple bucks. This is my first cast iron skillet. I did some research on the web before it came on care, and coated it with vegetable oil and baked it in the over at 500F for a few hours, then let it cool down to room temp. I know this is a per-seasoned pan, but I figured the factory coating would be a bit \"mass-produced\" at best, so added a coat of my own before using it. I\\'ve used it for bacon and eggs, pancakes, and a chili like dish, as well as for frying some fries in vegetable oil, which really seemed to improve the coating. I plan on frying up some chicken in oil next. The pan is great, very good quality and very heavy. nice and big, make sure to have a very large surface stovetop. not much else fits next to this one when we are cooking a lot of food. but it seems good and sturdy for a cast iron. make sure to read up on how to care for cast iron pans if you are new to the material. they can not be used like regular pans I love ourLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet!  I had wanted one for years, and I finally bought one. For us, it is an essential piece of equipment.TheLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet, a classic skillet, belongs in many kitchens.  It is reasonably priced, with reasonable care it can last at least a century, and it is versatile.  It is wise to buy theLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Cast-Iron Lidwith it to make cooking in a skillet safe and to increase the verstility of this skillet.We have used our skillet extensively, especially in recipe development for Flavored with Love: Mary Lou\\'s Family and Friends Can Cook and The Collard Patch.  On the blog at Mary Lou Cheatham\\'s Profile, you can find the most delicious cornbread we have ever eaten. It is Cathy\\'s Crawfish Cornbread.  To find it, it is necessary to go back to an older blog.  Here is another cornbread recipe  developed with our Lodge skillet:Butter Pecan CornbreadIngredients1 stick ( pound) unsalted butter1 cup chopped pecans1 tablespoon canola oil1 cups self-rising cornmeal mix1 cup self-rising flour teaspoon baking powder1 cup milk3 eggs, beaten2 tablespoons honeyPreparation--In a small saucepan melt the butter with the pecans in it.  Don\\'t burn the butter, but let the pecans cook slightly.  Allow them to cool.--Heat the oven to 450.  Heat the skillet with the oil in it.--Combine the dry ingredients.--Add the remaining ingredients.--Spoon the batter into the hot skillet.--Bake 10-12 minutes.One of the problems people seem to have with the skillet is sticking.  Since I use it to cook cornbread, I usually heat the oil in it in the oven and pour the warmed oil into the cornbread batter immediately before pouring it into the skillet.  As a result, it never sticks, and the cornbread has irresistble crust.  I have sprayed it generously with Pam(PAM-Original No Stick Cooking Spray, 3/8oz Cans) to cook other foods and had great results.Every meal we cook would present some opportunity to use the iron skillet, but we don\\'t use it every day because we have become leery of cooking a large amount of our food in iron.  We are trying to protect our heart health, and there has been much concern lately about cooking in iron pots and pans.  It is believed that doing so can increase iron.  Too much iron is suspected to increase atherosclerosis. (Another more sinister but rare risk is possible damage to the liver.)  We don\\'t allow these warnings to keep us from using our skillet to make our favorite cornbreads, to cook steaks effortlessly with great results, to broil salmon, to cook fajitas, and to saute onions. We enjoy the skillet anyway.I hope you find this review helpful. I am loving my cast iron. These comeper-seasoned making it a plus. I just washit as soon as it cools in hot water, dry it, andspray it with oil so its ready to go when neededkeeping it non-stick. I use this at least 3 or 4 times a week for breakfast sandwiches.  It\\'s the perfect size for an English muffin, or roasting some garlic and onions.My seasoning was not perfect and some flaked off.  I\\'ve been able to patch up that spot by reseasoning over it. You\\'ll notice, wrapped around the handle when you recieve this skillet -  that there is a ribbon on this which says &#34;Made in America&#34;. That\\'s right folks, God\\'s blessed country, her purple mountains and the land of the free is responsible for this the very pinnacle of gastronomical technology. An example of American manufacturing done right, her steelworkers painstaking attention to detail and worksmanship.When you cook on this skillet, you\\'re not just cooking on a skillet. You are repatriating your stomach. You\\'re using your perfectly even heated service as a proclamation of your love for our majestic American landscape.  Each and every time you wipe down this skillet without soap you are saying to your country, &#34;I am free&#34;.You plop a chicken on this thing and put it in the oven for an hour and what you get is not roasted chicken, no sir, the result is a centerpiece upon a steel mantle that will get even the most puritanical man some action tonight.This skillet has gone through everything with me. It\\'s heft and weight will surely aid me in self defense should an intruder ever break in (i wouldn\\'t blame him, the aromas this skillet has filled my house with are hypnotic).This skillet was rated by America\\'s Test Kitchen as being the best skillet on Earth. I\\'m happy to report that my test kitchen was able to verify this information. This pan might infuriate you for the first couple of weeks you have it (even if you season it on your own) but once you get a nice coating on there it becomes a great everyday pan. I use it for bacon, eggs, hash, roasting chickens, quesadillas, and the list goes on and on. A nice coat of oil every few weeks keeps it looking and working like a vintage cast iron pan at a quarter of the price. Just finished making a T Bone. Crushed pepper some salt your \"lodge Logic\" and you have one great Dinner. Clean up is a breeze! Like everyone said you will Love it. Love it...this is my favorite pan.I had one in a different size for years.Bought this larger one and it is just as great.Very heavy, heats evenly, cooks everything great.Good deal on amazon.BONUS it is made here in the USA.Highly recommend this...you will have it for the rest of your life. This Lodge is a decent pan, though it has some issues. Like other reviewers, I found that the initial black coating was uneven, or applied weirdly in some areas. Secondly, the interior of the pan is WAY too rough to be truly non-stick. The idea of non-stick cast iron comes from the interior finish being smooth and seasoned. I\\'ve felt Lodge pans wherever I go, and they are ALL very rough on the interior. I took the roughness down with 120 grit then 220 grit sandpaper, then seasoned it twice, and now it\\'s easy to use and works well. But this took me over two hours to sand alone.In the end, I\\'d opt for a vintage, turn of the century pan like a Wagner on eBay...you\\'ll pay a bit more for it, but it will be truly non-stick, and you\\'ll most likely be eating off a pan that cooked a meal for some burly pioneer dude. These are the best skillets for everything.  Reminds me of my Mom\\'s cooking.  The older it gets the more flavorful your food turns out. I teetered back and forth between this one and the larger size, thinking this might not be big enough. I\\'m glad I chose this one. It\\'s huge, and, well, how much is there to say about a chunk of iron that you heat up and cook stuff in. I assume anyone reading this review has already read up on the cooking properties of iron, yadda yadda yadda, so I won\\'t bother. I will say that this perticular skillet appears to be very well made, the walls are an even thickness and the burrs left grom the forging process have been cleaned off nicely. I looked at a 10\" skillet in a department store that was $40, made in Malaysia, not pre seasoned and appeared to have been made in a garage. No comparison. Buy the Lodge. The free shipping and quick delivery give Amazon an extra star as well. This is an excellent skillet at an excellent Amazon price. Huge and heavy, this pan heats evenly and holds lots of food, which is the reason I bought it. our standard 10&#34; cast iron skillet just doesn\\'t hold enough to feed the kids anymore. I\\'ve had great luck with a lodge dutch over and stove top grill/griddle.  In a recent move I somehow managed to misplace my grandmothers old cast iron pan.  I was a bit sad about not have that pan anymore but didn\\'t think of it as anything more than a lost memory.How wrong I was.  By comparison this thing is junk.  It is significantly thinner and has a very short handle.  This is not to say it\\'s a bad pan - it\\'s just not up to the old stuff.  I\\'m not going to return it, in fact I\\'ll use it without complaint.  I am, however, going to keep my eye open for something more substantial.In retrospect I should have ordered a 12\" pan.  I\\'m not sure why but 10\" of cast iron just looks small. I am a complete cast-iron convert and own about 7-8 main cooking pieces.  Size is a major issue when deciding on a pan--This is the right pan for:--Side dishes for a family--Main dishes for a single person--cornbreadThis is not the right size for you:--if you have a very large family and want to make sides/main dishes in itAs with all lodge products, this is well made and, with the right care, will last more than a lifetime.  I own one non-lodge cast iron skillet and it has developed a hairline crack in it.  I\\'ll never buy anything but lodge now. Great size! Yes, it\\'s heavy so I don\\'t want to hang it on my pot rack. What if it falls and cracks the counter? If you\\'re not careful, it rusts. You have to hand wash, dry well (very important to dry it carefully) then spray on oil and wipe it to distribute the oil to every crevice. But I knew that when I bought it.It heats up quickly and you can heat it to REALLY HOT, I mean searing temperature. It\\'s a great way to sear meat to keep the juices in. However, it retains heat really well so turning down the stove won\\'t have any effect for a long time. I use a second, pre-heated pot at a lower temperature.This pot is everything a cast iron pan should be. What more can I say? The final state of matter, even stars*, has to be good as cookware.*In case you didn\\'t know, once any star has burned up all its other material and starts to make iron, it\\'s headed for nova -- death. I bought my first cast iron piece last year...an enameled dutch oven from Ledge and I love it.  I used it all. the. time.  I\\'ve always wanted un-coated cast iron though just to try it.  The Pioneer Woman on Food Network has me convinced!  :)  I got the 8 inch and wished I would have gotten the bigger one already.  I have a glass topped stove and I felt the bottom of this skillet and it\\'s perfectly smooth and does fine on glass top.  Just don\\'t drag it all around...which you won\\'t anyway because it\\'s heavy!  This will outlive me by far...great quality.  Highly recommend Lodge brand.  I was not paid to review this product and I do no work for Lodge or Amazon. I am so excited to use this pan. It is huge and I can roast a whole chicken in it or make 3 quarts of French onion soup in it. I read a lot of reviews of these. I grew up on a cast-iron pan house, and cooked a lot of moosemeat in one. But I was a kid then, and really didn\\'t have a clue one from another. So when I read the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I wanted something I could make single-serving egg dishes in for myself. Well, I LOVE this. It is, indeed, rough (not smooth) on the inside, but I have a feeling that this is a GOOD thing. It comes pre-seasoned (vegetable oil), and I seasoned it before first use with canola oil. I rubbed it, heated it, and threw it in the oven to keep it clean. Then I baked something, and left it in there. Finally I used it for scrambled eggs. NOTHING STUCK to the pan! Then I got brave and cooked a cheese and jalepeno omelette. NOTHING STUCK to the pan! In fact, I can put a 3-egg and cheese mix in the pan, let it set on a medium burner for a few minutes, put the stainless steel/walnut spatula (sold on Amazon) under it, flip it intact, turn off the heat, then just flip the pan over and drop it out onto a plate. NOTHING STICKS! And I cannot say that for my older teflon pan from a big-name anodized aluminum maker. At all.So when you wash it, use a plastic brush and warm water... not even hot. Then rub a little vegetable oil on it, and put it into the oven and let it reside there the next time you bake. OR just heat it on the burner and let it smoke.BIG TIP FOR CAST IRON AND STAINLESS PANS: Let them heat up BEFORE you add any cooking oil as you first start to cook. Things will not stick. If you add things to a cold pan, they will very likely give you problems. I have to say - I LOOOOVE cast iron!  Love it!  It wasn\\'t until the last few years that I discovered the joys of cooking with cast iron - both with Le Creuset enameled cookware and this fabulous Lodge Logic cast iron.I use cast iron to cook nearly everything - It\\'s heat retention and even cooking is superior to everything - including stainless steel - I have a few stainless steel pots, as well as cast aluminum - and nothing beat cast iron.This skillet, in my mind, is a must-have for any kitchen.  Anything you could use a skillet or frying pan for, you can use this.  I\\'ve made the best homecooked steaks in this pan, phenomenal burgers, incredible fish, sauces, braised meats, you name it.  Sear it on the stove top and throw it in the oven for a quick broil - do it all in this pan.Best of all - the cheapest pan I own is the one that I use the most and will last me forever...Get this pan, you won\\'t regret it!! Such a great investment.A lot of the 1-star reviews seem to be related to people not knowing how to properly care for the cast iron or cook with it. If you\\'re not familiar with it, it\\'s totally different than your standard stainless or non-stick cookware.Being a nerd, I did a lot of research before I invested in cast iron and am glad I did. Don\\'t be fooled by the idea of this pan being pre-seasoned; you\\'ll need to put in some upfront work to get good results. If you\\'re looking for a low maintenance pan, this isn\\'t it. Caring for cast iron isn\\'t onerous, but there is some continuous care needed to keep your cast iron in good shape. If you do, you can expect it to last for year, decades even.Google Sheryl Canter and Chemistry of Cast Iron; I followed this method and had no issues with food sticking from the very first use, cornbread mind you.I also recommend investing in some steel wool, coarse salt, and a sturdy brush (I use bamboo). The steel wool is good if your pan rusts, the salt is great for cleaning residue and the bamboo brush is excellent for tough stuck on food debris. My only other piece of advice is to let the pan cool before getting it wet to clean it.I would definitely by more Lodge products, this one doesn\\'t disappoint. I\\'ve got this one and the 10 1/4\" skillet.  For a family of 5, this size is perfect.  It easily handles 3 lbs. of ground beef, a double batch of Hamburger Helper, or 8 small chicken breasts.  This is the pan I reach for most often.  However, it\\'s not quite perfect.  I\\'m having a devil of a time getting pancakes to cook evenly.  Others have mentioned uneven heating due to it\\'s size, and I\\'ve wondered the same thing.  If the only flaw in this pan is imperfect pancakes, I can easily live with it and find a more suitable pan for the pancakes.  This is my \"go to\" pan whenever I\\'m cooking for our crew; can\\'t imagine cooking without it.  It browns & carmelizes beautifully. First the delivery was prompt..thank you Amazon..Being an iron skillet, it is heavy..but with the extra loop, it makes it easier to move, etc.. They say no soap, and I have a 12 inch that looks like new....I use a scotchbrite scrub sponge to wash it in dawn, and rinse it really, really well...then put it on the stove and heat the pan to hot...turn off burner, and pore a little vegetable oil in the pan, and take a paper towel and make sure you cover bottom and inside sides with this oil.  Just let it sit on stove till has cooled...it is again pre-seasoned and ready for use.  The heat completely dries the pan out, to prevent rust...and it keeps the pan looking like new.Once you have tasted fried chicken done in a iron pan with \\'shortening\\' not oil....you will never use anything else to cook chicken, except maybe a deep frier...I LOVE IT! If you\\'re into cast iron cooking, this brutal hunk of metal will do the job with no apologies.  Works well on induction stoves, although be wary of scratching your induction top.  If this skillet was a person he would be a lumberjack and your steak and eggs would taste like when you go camping and you cook breakfast over the fire.  If you\\'re at all curious about cast iron cooking then this is a no brainer.Heavy enough to use as a weapon in the event a burglar breaks in to steal your steak and eggs. I have several cast-iron products including a wok, grill pan and a couple of Dutch ovens.  I\\'ve been using them for years without a single complaint.  I have a full set of All Clad stainless frying pans that are somewhat non-stick if you know how to use them.  I\\'ve heard so much about Grandma\\'s priceless iron frying pan that I had to give it a try.  Compared to stainless, iron heats up slowly but keeps the heat much longer.  The pre-seasoning isn\\'t much because real seasoning takes years.  This is beacuse the iron is rough and only through use become smooth.  My complaints relate to the handle: First it is too short so you can\\'t get a proper grip and second it gets hot enough to burn you (unlike stainless).  I guess I\\'ll get used to these problems and learn to appreciate the ultimate cooking surface that iron provides. To answer my main concern (and maybe yours too), \"Is it too big for my stove top?\" the answer is no! (Maybe it is for the feint hearted). I have a basic gas burner stove top.  Every size of pan requires some amount stirring because of hot spots. And yes, this pan also requires food to be stirred. Every few minutes or so, I even moved it slightly over the flame in a triangle fashion. The cast iron held its heat very well. They make different shaped pans for a reason, don\\'t try and make something in this pan over the stove top that it wasn\\'t designed to.  My first meal I cooked 2 lbs of hash browns! They turned out great, and everyone was served hot hash browns at the same time! And one benefit of the large size is that I did not have any hash browns falling out as I stir (I commonly over filled my smaller pans).  If you are still unsure, then just opt for the 12 inch cast iron pan. Remember you also have to find a place to store such a big pan.15 inches upper diameter, and 12 inches on bottom. The picture on Amazon is incorrect. It does not have a side pour notch. How can you rate it any other than 5 stars. It is exactly what it is suppose to be...a huge, heavy, cast iron skillet that is great for large meals. Furthermore, it was only $35.Please do not rate a product lower because Amazon may have misspelled something. That is the time when you contact Amazon customer service, not by giving a product 4 stars.When you buy Cast Iron you are buying a piece of history and with that comes a time investment into the maintenance of your kitchen tools. I enjoy caring for my cast iron and enjoy learning how to. Those of us that \"get it\" don\\'t rate it lower and complain of their unrealistic expectations. Do your home work and read some Cast Iron blogs. It isn\\'t non-stick magic; it is just your grandma\\'s elbow grease! I already own a 12-inch Lodge Logic pre-seasoned cast-iron skillet but always found it too large for a lot of applications, too heavy, and too slow to heat up properly.  So I was debating on whether to purchase this 8-inch skillet or the 6 1/2-inch, and I\\'m glad I purchased this one.  This 8-inch skillet is perfect for making individual omelettes or cooking up smaller batches of vegetables, potatoes, etc.  Since the 8-inch diameter refers to the lip of the pan, the actual cooking surface is smaller than 8-inches so I can\\'t imagine getting the 6 1/2-inch skillet for anything other than a novelty item.On one last note, the pre-seasoning is actually not too bad and I was able to make some great eggs on my first use without them sticking.  Everyone here has their different way of cleaning cast-iron so I\\'ll add mine: after cooking and when the pan is still hot/warm, sprinkle in about 1Tbsp of kosher salt and rub this around the pan with a paper towel to scrape away any thing that\\'s left in the pan.  The salt acts as an abrasive and works pretty well.  Dump out the salt (careful, it\\'ll be hot) into the sink/trash, then add a little bit of cooking oil to the pan and spread it around using the same piece of paper towel.  That\\'s it.  I almost never wash my pans, unless there\\'s a sauce cooking in it (which I try to avoid, use stainless steel instead for tomato sauces). and lodge logic!  i have baked cornbread and made fried potatoes and bacon and all turned out the best i\\'ve ever made. easy cleanup and this is a quality pan.  i also love that they are an american company!  i dont want to echo the other reviewers too much just had to chime in that i am SO glad i have this product in my kitchen and will be using it ALOT. This little skillet is fantastic, as you would expect from Lodge.  Made in America quality, perfect form and function - you can\\'t go wrong with Lodge cookware.  I mostly use this for hot dips - keeps the dip warm for at least an hour without cords or flame - awesome for Game Day - by the time it\\'s cool, the dip is gone.  Also perfect for cooking a couple of eggs, but beyond fairly single-serve cooking, this skillet is a bit too small to be a work-horse.I Also have the 8 inch skillet, and that size is a bit more versatile - large enough to grill a sandwich or a couple of chicken breasts. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who loves cooking. He says the pan is fantastic. He cooks eggs, chicken, pancakes, quesadillas, etc. in it. The pan can even be put in our oven for when he wants to make a fritata or cornbread. He feels confident that I bought a pan that could be used in another 80 years.There is no insulating handle, so make sure you have potholders or oven mitts - the pan gets hot and retains the heat for a while. Also, be sure to follow the care instructions: this pan needs to be seasoned after use. Purchased for my wife. She loves it, and the food is excellent. Very different from the other stuff you use daily, but this heats fast and hold very even heat to whatever your cooking. There is simply no better pan for certain uses than a genuine American cast iron skillet.  Arrives ready to use.  Size for 4 eggs or a two person breakfast.  Love this pan and use it all the time.  It\\'s the real deal!  If you don\\'t know how to use cast iron, check it out and then buy this pan! So, this was the first Cast-Iron Pan I bought, It did everything so well from day one, that I had to add the Lid - do not buy this without the lid. Stove top or Oven, this pan outshines them all. Now, I still use by Anodized pans too, but when I work with heavy meats and juices, the cast iron is the beast. I love my Lodge cast iron skillet.  This one is very large.  You can easily grill 6 large boneless chicken breasts at the same time, with room to spare.  You have a lot of surface area.  I have nothing bad to say about this skillet.  Just be sure to take good care of it and always coat it with oil after you clean it so it doesn\\'t rust! My wife \"dragged\" me to an outlet mall the other day.  I wandered around with a couple of the kids and wound up at a kitchen store.  I bought the lodge 8\" for a few dollars more than the Amazon price (didn\\'t check beforehand).  My mom had a 12\" cast iron frying pan that she constantly used when I was growing up.  At the time I thought it was kind of gross as it was crusty and she never actually washed it.  She would just wipe it out and run it under hot water and then dry it on the stove.  Despite the grossness the food always came out great so I didn\\'t complain.This lodge pan seems like a mini version of my mom\\'s.  Very solid and with proper care it could last for generations.  I have now used it probably about 5 times and each time it becomes a little more \"non-stick.\"  Today I made a shameful breakfast from the past.  Bacon and eggs (and I cooked the eggs in the bacon fat!)...horrifying and delicious! I\\'m not sure that my wife will allow that breakfast in the house more than one a week. ;-)The pan is just about perfect for cooking for one or making a side dish.  Here are a couple of things to remember:1. Follow the simple directions on the back of the label as far as use and care.2. Never use soap, wipe out the grease and then wash in hot water.  Use a stiff kitchen brush if needed.3. NEVER wash in a dish washer4. NEVER leave it wet...it will rust!5. Put about a teaspoon of cooking oil on a paper towel and rub the oil all over the pan after you towel dry it.6. This thing retains heat so take that into account when cooking.7. Mine is starting to act like a non-stick, but without potentially harmful chemicals.8. Cast iron should work on most cook tops, even induction.9. You may even get some beneficial iron in your diet!Reccomended. After reading all the glowing posts about seasoned cast iron, you\\'d wonder why anyone was ever persuaded to buy that nasty Teflon stuff when they already owned (back in the 50s and 60s) the  perfect non-stick pan.  Well I bought this pan and it hasn\\'t been that great for me.  For one thing, stuff tends to bake in and create a rough texture that is hard to clean.  It isn\\'t that smooth slick carbon that everyone else seems to rave about, its just burned food on the bottom.  Second, the surface of this pan is rough. From reading on the web, apparently until the 70s cast iron skillets were machined inside to a smooth finish, but the interior these days is left pretty much the way it comes out of the iron casting.  I\\'ve tried seasoning the pan in the oven with the techniques you can read about on the web, in Alton Brown\\'s books, etc and nothing has given me a smooth slick surface on the bottom.  Call me disappointed.  I know this is a minority opinion, swamped by all the people that just love this pan, but this has been my experience with it. Having used aluminum and steel pans ever since I started cooking, I\\'m thrilled at how much better food turns out when cooked on this pan. Steaks are seared much better, hash browns and fries are crispy outside, tender inside. It\\'s like my taste buds were asleep all this time. I guess I thought that that ranges for home use just weren\\'t hot enough to get restaurant quality food. I don\\'t think enough people know how good cast iron is to cook with and settle for substandard cookware like I did.This pan is heavy and pretty much indestructible, unlike non-stick pans that have limited useful lives. It\\'s also free of potentially harmful non-stick coatings. Though it comes pre-seasoned, before using it, I washed it and baked it at 200 degrees for 2 hours after spreading Crisco on it (lard is supposed to be even better for this). After this, it is 99% stick-free and the seasoning will just get better with time. The cast iron retains heat much better than steel or aluminum and spreads heat more evenly, which provides superior results, even when using a lower flame. I also love the fact that this pan can last several lifetimes. This pan (or any Lodge product) is an excellent value and something every household should have.Since I got this pan, however, I learned about the advantages of buying second hand cast iron such as Griswold or Wagner, made from the 1850s to the 1950s, and I picked up a couple myself. These pans are superior to modern Lodge pans (or any other current cast iron ware), but they will also be a bit more expensive (approx $50-$60 for an 11\" pan online) and usually need to be restored and re-seasoned, which requires some elbow grease. They are much lighter (about half the weight) and have a smooth, machined cooking surface, whereas the current Lodges have a rougher, pebbled surface (they stopped machining the surfaces at some point to cut costs). In my experience, the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface doesn\\'t significantly impair its non-stick properties, but the smooth surface of my antique pans is far superior and much nicer to cook on. With the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface, it\\'s not as easy to smoothly slide a stainless steel spatula under foods and it\\'s noisier, whereas with the old pans, a spatula glides effortlessly under foods. Like many things, cast iron cookware with the quality of the old days just isn\\'t being made anymore and will likely never be again.For price, performance and easy availability, however, I don\\'t think anything beats Lodge. Converted all our cookware over from a non-stick to Lodge and Le Creuset pots and pans.  The Lodge pan works great for almost all tasks.  The cast iron excels at all frying, and high temperature cooking.  I use another enameled pan for cooking liquidy foods so as to best preserve the nonstick seasoning of the Lodge cast iron.  Learn how to maintain this pan (oil after every use, don\\'t wash with soap only hot water, etc.) it will give you great non-stick performance.  If you are getting foods to stick on it after a week of breaking it in, you are not maintaining it properly.  I have also heard of additional benefit of these pans adding iron to your diet.  Not sure if that is true, but a potential benefit none the less. As I have been switching over to all cast iron cookware, I have purchased products from several manufacturers.  Lodge is simply the best I have found.The skillet is smooth and well balanced.  This time I used the pan with only a simple cleaning. I usually just go ahead and re-season them anyway. Turns out, Lodge truly is ready for use.  I had no trouble with sticking and it cleaned up quick and easy. (Then I seasoned it again anyway.  I just can\\'t help myself! lol!)Well made and ready for use.  What more do you want?  Well, I, for one, wish they made more different styles so I could stick to their product line alone.The Lodge stuff costs a bit more, but it is worth it. **** UPDATE 2 ****I\\'m still learning how to use this wonderful pan.  I\\'ve stopped cleaning it out in the sink.  I just leave it on the burner and clean it in place regardless of what I did with it.  I use Pam spray (not the old kind that leaves a residue), butter or olive oil while cooking, wipe it out with dry and wet paper towels immediately after removing the food, and recoat with spray and leave it on the burner to cool.  In most cases I can clean the pan so quickly my food is still hot when I sit down to eat.I now use it about as often as my nonstick skillet, although it\\'s horses for courses.If you broil steaks indoors in winter, try this: Lay some foil in the pan and shape it to fit.  Remove the foil.  Heat the pan on the burner until the oil starts to smoke.  Drop in the foil, drop in a steak or two and put the pan under the oven broiler.  Turn the steak as usual.  The steak cooks similar to how it would on a gas grill and cleanup is a matter of just lifting out the foil. Bend the foil to drizzle the accumulated juices over the steak.UPDATE***I\\'ve grown to like this pan more and more.  I now cook meals in it.  For example, at breakfast you can cook eggs, hash browns and bacon at the same time.  It\\'s all about the timing of when each ingredient goes in.  If you are diligent about keeping it well-oiled and don\\'t put food in until it\\'s pre-heated, the pan behaves as if it were non-stick.I wish the main handle was longer.  The pan is so heavy it\\'s hard to move around when cleaning.  It\\'s much easier to clean if you do it while it\\'s still warm.  I pretty much have to leave it on the stove and wipe it out with a bunch of wet paper towels.ORIGINAL REVIEWI bought this after getting frustrated trying to cook sea scallops in a regular pan and not getting a good sear.  This is the kind of pan you need for searing meats on a stove or in an oven.It\\'s got a rough texture finish inside.  Be sure it\\'s hot and has oil or butter on it before adding food to prevent sticking.  It cleans easily with just water and a sponge if you let it soak for a little while.  If you clean it with soap you need to heat it and rub oil on it to restore the seasoning coat that prevents the food from welding onto it.It\\'s really heavy!  Imagine holding a skillet with sand in it.  They\\'ve added on a handgrip on the opposite side of the handle so you can use two hands.  If the pan is warm (and it stays warm long after you turn off the burner) you\\'ll need potholders on both hands to move it to the sink for soaking or cleaning.I\\'m still experimenting with it, but I think it makes a great addition to the kitchen.  I use it much less often than my non-stick Circulon skillet, but it lets me do things I never could before and that\\'s sparking my creative juices. I\\'ve really enjoyed using this pot. I purchased it a year ago and it\\'s still in perfect condition. I like being able to put it in the oven as well as use it on the stove top.My only complaint is that it is extremely heavy. If your arms are not strong, it can be difficult to take it in and out of the oven without burning yourself accidentally. I am anemic, so I am using this skillet to put some extra iron into my system. When you cook eggs in it, you have to make sure that it is very oil or the eggs will stick. 15 inches is a lot of frying pan. This pan came ready-to-use, pre-seasoned as advertised. It probably weighs more than you do. No rough edges, nicely finished. Well worth the incredibly good price. This lodge skillets work great when cooking meats.  I usually brown on the stove-top and then put in the oven to finish cooking.  This skillet is heavy but well worth its weight.  Additionally, I purchase a glass lid that fits perfectly.  I use this when I cook vegetable stir-fry.  I am not an expert or an Iron Chef but my kitchen will always have a skillet.  I use the 12 inch for meats and vegetables and the 8 inch for cooking cornbread.  Highly recommend. Granted, I\\'m a newbie to cast iron, but I wanted to go that route especially for steaks and burgers cooked indoors. The quality of this product is excellent! Cooked some chicken apple sausage on this the other night...the sear was beautiful. I\\'ve made these sausages before in nonstick pans and they were nowhere near as good. Cooked a rib eye tonight. I\\'ve never been happy with the results of steaks cooked indoors before so only bbq\\'d, but this was far and away the best steak I have ever made. Totally owe it to the pan (and Alton Brown\\'s recipe). Will definitely be purchasing a LOT more Lodge cookware. And appreciate the fact that it\\'s a family business and this line is made in America. Considering the price and previous reviews, I bought this with high hopes. I was impressed with the size and weight but I must be doing something wrong because I\\'ve never successfully cooked eggs in it without getting them stuck to the bottom of the pan (even with adding oil each time). I even prepped it with oil and baking before using. If you are on the fence, don\\'t hesitate and get at least the L8SK3[10-1/4\"] and L10SK3[12\"]. Well made and made USA which is great to see. Like some have suggested, buy locally if you can. My local Walmart had these in stock, drove down and picked one of each that had a fairly smooth cooking surface. Cost was about the same just had to pay for tax, so like ~$3 more.Wanted to smooth the cooking surface a bit more, this what I did:First used 150 grit sandpaper and finished with 400 grit wet sandpaper. Just on the cooking surface, to sand down/remove any high spots. One can sand even more[mirror like finish], but this was enough for the skillets bought and not really necessary.Wash well with soap and a scouring pad or similar. Rinse/Dry immediately and throughly, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillets.Then re-season the skillets. Place them in the oven at 500F upside down on the top rack and with aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch drips. For 1 hour, let it cool down for ~30 minutes and repeat the re-seasoning process 3-5 times to get them well seasoned again.First time use was great. Cooked some sausage and scrambled eggs. The eggs did stick a little, but that is to be expected; as more seasoning/cooking is done that will be a thing of the past.For cleaning one can use a scrub brush as suggested or salt. Cleaning with salt works great, got the idea from [0].[0] http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKIOBGJ0W2M3/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&asin;=B0002F9AH2&cdForum;=Fx3EC6KN3NF72WV&cdMsgID;=Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6&cdMsgNo;=1&cdPage;=1&cdSort;=oldest&cdThread;=Tx36UJEPNPG0XE7&store;=home-garden#Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6Basically just pour some salt on the skillet and rub a bit[not hard, just enough to remove any stuck bits] with a paper towel.Rinse well with water [if skillet is warm/hot; use hot water], over the surface of the skillet. Dry immediately with paper/cloth towel throughly; place back on the stove/oven to fully dry, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillet while still warm/hot.Put away in a cool dry place with a paper towel over the skillet cooking surface to prevent rust[which should not happen; just as a precaution]. Lodge pre seasoned is the way to go. This is very heavy duty. The pre seasoned is nice, although you will eventually need to reseason it. Plus it is very heavy in case you get some unwanted intruders in your house. I don\\'t believe in guns. This is all you need for cooking and home protection. this was part of a cast-iron buying frenzy i went through recently.  it is a cute little griddle, and works great.  my only complaint was the preseasoning.  for some reason, it didn\\'t really work and my food stuck to it and was a mess to get off.  (although other preseasoned pans from lodge have been wonderful.) no worries, however--i reseasoned it myself (not really hard to do--just melt some crisco, cover the whole pan, and bake at 350 for an hour) and now it is nonstick. I bought this skillet thinking that it was a larger size (just an FYI, size 6 back in the day was actually an 8 inch pan.  Imagine my surprise when I got this one egg wonder!).  I didn\\'t want to ship it back since it was my own stupid fault and I\\'m a great believer that there is no such thing as useless cast iron.I use this pan mainly for making eggs in the morning or a two person portion of cornbread.  It is also a campsite necessity as it fits perfectly on myLodge Logic L410 Pre-Seasoned Sportsman\\'s Charcoal Grill.  It is great for those who worry about the tough clean up involved in new cast iron.  This skillet is light and a breeze to clean.I have found that all of my Lodge cookware is versatile and very durable and easy to clean.  I always season them twice before using, however.  I\\'m a little crazy about my cookware being super non-stick. Cheap, healthy (you get some extra iron!), works really well, multifunctional (you can use it as a weapon, because it is very heavy of course). I have a lid that fits well luckily, otherwise I would say that this is the only thing that would be missing. You have to dry it immediately or it rusts of course. Not a problem, because you can always wash that off or better wipe it off with a paper towel and some oil. I recommend it as a staple pan for every serious cooking. I have been looking for another good iron skillet for a while, not findin anything in the stores that i like.  I decided to go to Amazon.com.  I seem to always find things on Amazon i can find anywhere else.the skillet is great heavy and already seasoned - only thing i wish it was a little bigger.Other than that a great skillet for everyday stove top and oven use. Bought 3 different sizes of these to fill out my set.  I use them for everything even scrambled eggs.  Cleaning is a snap, just rinse with warm water and scrub with a stiff veggie brush to get rid of everything.  For tough items just put an inch of water and put it on the stove on high and boil the water.  Scrub gently with veggie brush and it cleans easy.  Then dry and leave it for awhile to make sure it\\'s completely dry.  Add a thin layer of coconut oil.  You cannot kill these things either.  You can clean and re-season them if they are old or rusty.  Health benefits also.  Will be using these for the rest of my life.  Lodge is also USA made! Served me well for the last 2 months...bit too heavy for people with arthritis or spondylosis..think twice...cooks great...browns beautifully...be careful to follow the instructions and it will last u long. I didn\\'t realize just how large this pan would be but it\\'s a big skillet! Ideal for large families and those who cook for an army like myself :) Really nice quality....AND how can you beat free shipping with this?! Highly recommend. No disappointments here. I was a little concerned, after reading some of the reviews about having to re-season these pieces, but not to worry.  Like one of the other reviewers, I initially tried it out with eggs, right after receiving it...definitely stuck to the pan.  I started to cook all my greasy food in this pan, and after about a month, it improved significantly!  Today, I fried eggs with only a little cooking oil (same conditions as with my teflon frying pan), and to my surprise, the eggs didn\\'t stick!  My husband actually asked me to fry another one for him!  I\\'m VERY happy I bought this, and will continue to use this for a long time.  Cleaning is actually not so bad, I scrub it out under hot water, then put it back on the stove, heat it to dry, then coat with oil. Thanks to all the reviewers and their input, which helped me to decide to go cast iron! With handle on the other side, it makes it perfect not only for stove top ,but campfire as well.  Versatile and a delight to have. It\\'s pre-seasoned just right to start. Clean up is a breeze. I carefully pour hot water into the skillet while it is still hot. It bubbles up & when the water settles down, I pour it out & nothing is left sticking to the pan, although I still use the Lodge Logic cast iron brush on it while under hot running water. I pat it dry & rub the oil back on over the entire skillet. Everything taste better when it\\'s cooked in seaoned cast iron & this brand is durable & you have many sizes to choose from. Pros:It heats very evenly and cooks better than any cookware I have owned. The temperature control is fantastic, as it rises and cools slowly. The seasoning and patina it develops provides a natural non-stick coating. It\\'s also great as it adds a touch of healthy iron to your diet as you cook, instead of unhealthy Aluminum, Chromium, or Teflon that is in most modern cookware.This has some great benefits from a cooking and health standpoint.Cons:Quite heavy. About Eight Pounds empty. Those with weak wrists and arms need not apply. Two hand hold required.Tips:You must have goot pot holders, as the uninsulated handles will get hot when cooking.Don\\'t scrub hard as it removes the seasoning.Don\\'t let it air dry, it will rust.Don\\'t put it in the dishwasher, as it will remove the seasoning.Leave it a little oily after you cook I use on gas stove and out door grill. clean up couldn\\'t be easier.hot water, brush and a slight coat of vegtable oil I was happy to finally find these 6 1/2 in. cast iron skillets. I ordered eight of them, I make homemade hamburger buns and Schloskies\\' type bread, and cornbread in them. They are great. My kitchen couldn\\'t operate without my cast iron cookware. From roaring campfire to smooth new designer range, it works with everything. (After a mix-up with the shipping company, I found my order and all turned out well.) LOVE AMAZON, you\\'re my store!Rita McWhorter I\\'ve loved this pan from the moment I seasoned it, and have used it several times a week since.  The 10.25-inch is a perfect size for the 2 of us, and allows you to pretty easily cook up a couple thick, 10oz steaks (or so).  Some days I wish I had a 12&#34;, when we have company over, but this size is perfect for 2-3 people for most dishes.The cast iron requires a bit different attention than a &#34;standard&#34; pan, but I\\'ve found it definitely to be worth it and it\\'s just about developing new habits.  Love it. I like to have one iron skillet in my pots and pans collection. I chose this one because of the top reviews. I use it for frying bacon and for making corn bread. I am very happy with the quality of this pan. Yes this skillet is high maintenance because it is cast iron, but it is because it is cast iron that you won\\'t be steered wrong. Its heavy, its heats really fast and it comes pre-seasoned. I especially appreciate these small cast iron skillets by lodge.  They are wonderful for melting, reheating foods.  I don\\'t have to bother with a large skillet, clean up, etc, when wanting to cook or reheat a small amount.  They\\'re also fun for baking small amounts of cornbread and cakes. I bought this because a good friend who was visiting put my 100+ yr old skillet in the dishwasher.  Yes, I cried & it was all I could do not to wring her neck.I love this skillet now, but straight from the store the preseason was worthless.I have the fancy corn bread pans and their large reversible griddle.  These items came seasoned and none worked like that antique pan I thought was ruined.Another friend asked me to her camp house and she said bring all your cast iron you want to season, because you\\'ll be doing mine as well.This is what I did.Scrubbed all of it using Dawn.Dried it with flour sack towels, I buy from Sam\\'s Club.Put all the cookware on the campfire so it was definitely dry.Pulled out of the campfire, waited for it to cool enough to handle.Grabbed my bucket of lard, yes I said lard.  Greased everything with a medium coat. The inside should show the white grease.Put all of it back on the campfire for about an hour, right side up. Pulled it off to cool again. Started the process over again.Once I felt the insides were right, I flipped every thing over and started the process again.It did take most of the day, but I saved my 100+ yr old skillet.If you can\\'t get to a campfire, a gas or wood burning grill will do it as well, as long as it has a lid.If you don\\'t like the idea of lard, a good friend uses shortening.  She buys the generic version.  I use lard because I\\'m 4th generation using my antique skillet.  I guarantee they didn\\'t have vegetable shortening.I do not recommend the cactus cornbread stick pan.  13 yrs of using & I still can\\'t get those puppies non stick. My reversible griddle is great on the grill and camping, but not on my electric coil range. It doesn\\'t heat evenly and it\\'s a pain to clean.If you get your cast iron seasoned properly, it will be heaven to use and last forever.  If you don\\'t, cussing will happen.Washing it, properly seasoned is a breeze.  Usually a swipe with a paper towel.  If stuff has stuck, a green scrubby and hot water.  Worse case scenario, use some dish soap.  If you feel the need to use soap and water definitely put in on a burner for a few minutes to make sure it\\'s dry and then use your vegetable oil of choice to smear it in every nook and cranny.Finally, spoke with a Lodge representative.  Took me forever to find a phone number.  They have never responded to my emails.  My impression is they know, the seasoned Logic stuff is going to give you fits.  They just don\\'t care.The customer service person I did speak with did say, even the Logic needs to be seasoned 3 to 5 times.She did tell me if you put it in your oven at 400F for 2 hours it will take off their stuff.  After you\\'ve used some steel wool and soap to wash it first.I think they do a huge disservice to the joy of using cast iron. I understand why they season it. They want the folks who didn\\'t grow up with it, to try it.  Sadly, they don\\'t do it well.Getting it right, is still the same as my 3x great grandmother did it and it requires patience. This is a very high quality pan that makes great food. It\\'s large, big enough for 2-3 steaks. It\\'s very heavy. I\\'m a big fan of cast iron, and specifically a fan of inexpensive, made in USA Lodge cast iron cookware. Their 12\" cast iron skillet is one of the most used items in my kitchen. That said, I wasn\\'t really sure that I needed the huge 15 1/4\" version. Then I started looking around for a paella pan. I quickly realized that for the about the same amount of money as a 14-15\" thin steel specialty paella pan, I could have this Lodge cast iron 15 1/4\" skillet, which is both more durable and more versatile.It\\'s proven to be good at paella on the grill, and is useful for cooking up a whole mess of zucchinis, or other large batches etc. It\\'s also earned it\\'s keep turning brisket into BBQ. It\\'s big enough that you can make two omelets side-by-side in the thing, (though making them individually in one of the smaller skillets is easier).Like all of the Lodge cast iron cookware, this is built to last and is very easy to use and maintain. Highly recommended. This is an exact replacement for the one I had in Kuwait and without even using it yet, I know it will do a superb job of baking my corn bread.  Delivery was fast and as soon as this warm weather passes, it will get a workout. I use this more than any other pot/pan in my collection - it is THE BEST skillet for searing meats.  My husband & I live in an apt so grilling steaks is a hassle...but we don\\'t miss it much b/c this skillet is totally made of win.  It even works well on our awful (but pretty) glass-top stove.  Yes it\\'s heavy, but it\\'s freaking cast iron - what do you expect?  That\\'s why there are 2 handles, and use mitts for both when the pan is hot.  I use salt to clean it, similar to this method, with a few tweaks:[...]Cast iron also produces the best cornbread, so I\\'ve used it for that as well.  I just bought a Lodge cast-iron grill pan as well, can\\'t wait to use it! There\\'s most definitely a learning curve to this pan, but once you\\'ve mastered the sky\\'s the limit!  From pancakes to potstickers, everything I make comes out perfectly. I am very pleased with my Lodge 12 in. skillet. It is made well, seasoned reasonably well, and I love that handle on the other side for lifting!  Was shipped quickly and well packed. Do you like bacon? Buy this.Do you like hamburgers? Buy this.Do you like steak? Buy this.My favorite pan.  It is so useful and so easy to cook with.  Cleanup is a snap.  All it takes is a good amount of hot water and scrubbing, but NEVER soap.  Keep this skillet properly seasoned, and it\\'ll be your new best friend. As person who loves to cook I love anything that makes cooking easier.  So when I first got married, I wanted stainless steel everything.  I bought a beautiful set of stainless steel T-Fal cookware.  I quickly learned that stainless steel is not the way to go unless you want to be best friends with Pam (the cooking spray) or if you use a lot of cooking oils (butter, grease, shortening) in your foods.  So I bought more T-Fal, this time I purchased 2 non-stick skillets for my daily usage.  I learned a short time after purchasing that non-stick fades.  Suddenly I started finding little black chips in my eggs and the interior of the skillet had all kinds of scratches as the non-stick coating was peeling.  I did some research and found this is a common occurence in non-stick cookware.  And it will happen to every item sooner or later.  I also found that the little non-stick chips are toxic.  Well, that was enough for me.  What else is there?  Cast Iron.  I decided to buy an iron skillet for the health benefits as well as the longevity of the cookware.  How many grandmothers, mothers and aunt have a cast iron skillet from 20, 30, years ago?  Pretty much every cook I know.  So I knew going into the purchase that this would be a long term investment of time.  But after 3 years... it was all worth it.I cook pretty much everything in this skillet.  From eggs to fried chicken to alfredo sauce to grilled cheese sandwiches.  This is my go to skillet.  The only thing I dont cook in this is anything with tomatoes or tomato sauce.  The acid from the tomato just kills the nice non-stick loving I have going in this skillet.  Besides that its a perfect size for large and small meals.I\\'ve heard of different methods for cleaning and seasoning an iron skillet.  As much as they say that this skillet is pre-seasoned, it is not non-stick yet.  You have to do that work yourself.  Personally, this is what I did when I first got it.I used it for everything!  Eggs, baked chicken, fried foods, burgers, pretty much anything you can cook.  You have to actually USE it.After I cook in it, I cleaned it with only HOT water and a really really tough nylon scrub brush.  Sometimes, I would sit and scrub that thing for what seemed like hours.  Sometimes, it took an overnight soaking in hot water to get out baked on lasagna.  Never use dish detergent or put it in the dishwasher.  The soap with eat away at the non-stick layer you\\'re slowing building up.Either way, after you clean it, dry it completely with a towel.  Not a paper towel because the surface of the skillet will scratch away little fibers from the paper towel and you\\'ll have small white things stuck to your skillet.  Place the skillet on the stove on high heat and use a small bit of shortening and very, very, lightly grease the interior of the skillet.  I have an old cotton dinner napkin that I keep specifically for this purpose.  Keep it on the burner and let it heat up until you see the skillet begin to smoke.  Turn off the burner and let the skillet sit while it cools.Over time, using this method every time will get you that nice non-stick layer.  Of course, this layer is just shortening or cooking grease building up and baking into the skillet.3 years into this, I don\\'t have to season it like this anymore.  I just cook on it, wash it with hot water and my scrub brush and dry it completely. Good luck with this method. This is my first cast iron skillet and is in great condition. It\\'s easy to clean, cooks my food evenly. Even though the reviews had mentioned this about ALL cast iron skillets, but it surprised me how heavy it was. A great addition to my collection. This is a great little pan. I wish I had one of these as a scout instead of an aluminum mess kit. I had no idea you could use them straight on a fire back then. It would have been so much better.Anyway, this is great for pretty much anything you want to fry or bake. It works well for baking in a toaster oven, too.As with all cast-iron pans (even if they\\'re pre-seasoned) expect eggs to stick the first time you cook them on it. After you\\'ve cooked eggs a few times (with plenty of oil), they shouldn\\'t stick in future. Pretty much everything else seems non-stick from the get-go, though.Anyway, this is a great first pan. Good for learning the ins and outs of cast-iron. I strongly recommend branching out to larger pans, though. The Lodge 12 inch one is awesome. I am very happy with this skillet and use it all the time but it is too heavy to hold with one hand by a sixty-something woman with bad joints.  If I had it to do all over again I would have bought the 10&#34; skillet.  It also needs the &#34;silicone assist handle holder&#34; to hold the second handle when it is hot because the potholder isn\\'t as good for that as for holding a regular handle.  It cooks beautifully though. I am a gal who loves to cook like my mom cooked...with cast iron pans. These are the best skillets ever. Just make sure to get on the web site &#34;whatscookingamerica.net&#34; so you know how to season these skillets. Fried chicken is the best in a cast iron skillet! Great quality gift for the holidays. Used alot and cooks wonderfully. Will be used for many breakfast mornings. Nice item. The product is in excellent quality. Good size.  It is also pretty cheap.  I think it will last forever if I don\\'t abuse it.  I feel safe to use this iron skillet replace my non stick coating. We have an off-brand cast iron pan, and the Lodge one is definitely better. My husband prefers cooking with cast iron and this is the one he uses the most! Not too big, not too small! You buy these skillets for their durability.  These are preseasoned, so grab and go, and they are heavy.  Taking them camping, you know they won\\'t dent or otherwise fail.  GREAT value and I will definitely buy more Lodge brand products. I needed a second cast iron skillet and this one fit the bill. It is made well and is solid. The basis for these judgments is on the even-heating and cooking speeds of items in this skillet. It did come pre-seasoned but I chose to clean it and re-season it just for my own personal knowledge and comfort. Preseasoned skillet works well.  If you have never used cast iron (I had not), be warned it holds heat all over so handle carefully and when using oil, be advised to use a low smoke point oil such as canola or safflower.  I used an oil that burst into flames.  A good investment are the handle covers, silicone or pot holder type.  The 12&#34; skillet is good when you want to cook foods and not crowd your skillet but beware it is heavy.  I think this is a great, time honored piece of kitchen equipment. Used this for a long time now.  Holds up wonderfully and even though stainless steel is my favorite cookware (learn to use it first) this is my most used pan of all lol. After reading reviews I seasoned it again - I decided it wouldn\\'t hurt. and it didn\\'t.  The skillet is good when cooking for one.  I would recommend it. This pan is fabulous. I, finally, can cook crispy chicken, fish and french fries. I bought the 8 inch skillet, as well. This is , honestly, the most non stick cookware I have ever used- and I have an entire set of high end Circulon. Eggs slip out with ease and without any  residue in the pan. Omelettes, actually, come out like heaven. I seasoned both pans according to another reviewer\\'s instructions. I slathered them inside and out with Crisco, placed them upside down in a 500 degree oven for two hours  with cookie sheets beneath to catch drips. Then, let them cool in the oven over night. I repeated the process the next night. I\\'m anxious to use the lid, which I also bought, to prepare some steaks in the manner another reviewer suggested. I\\'m having great fun rediscovering cooking. BTW, another reviewer complained that the pan\\'s interior is very rough. I do not think that is the case at all. Good luck! Have fun! I bought this pan on a whim for the purpose of finding a use for it.  It\\'s perfect for single serves of sausages and other small items but I\\'ve found it\\'s best use for me is roasting peppers.  As someone who cooks extensive Mexican cuisine I am constantly roasting pepper or other vegetables and using this versus over a direct flame is far less messy.  Although this isn\\'t an item i use everyday it is well constructed and purposeful. Nothing much to say here except you can\\'t go wrong with this skillet. Heavy duty. Will probably last a lifetime unless you do something very stupid with it. And doubles as a lethal weapon in the event of a home-invasion. Winner! :) I cook every night for a family of 5. I recently acquired the Lodge Double Dutch 5 qt. dutch oven and fell in love with cast iron. I ordered this skillet thinking the bigger size would be good to cook for my large family and I was right, but when I say it\\'s big I mean it\\'s MASSIVE (and heavy!). I wiped it down with some flax seed oil and put it into my heated oven and it fit with very little wiggle room. It certainly will not fit in my cabinets so it will have to live on my stove-top which is just fine by me.A lot of reviewers have complained about the \"rough\" finish on the inside of the skillet. To me, it doesn\\'t seem that rough. There is a definite texture to it but nothing that will totally destroy the integrity of your food, in my opinion. Don\\'t let a little texture steer you away from buying this bargain-priced skillet - you can always season, season, season to get that smooth patina cast iron is renowned for.One thing to note is that the product picture indicates that there are two pour spouts between each handle. My skillet does not have the pour spouts. That\\'s slightly disappointing but this skillet is so heavy that I doubt I will be able to gracefully pour anything out of this thing, pour spouts or not. Amazon should update its picture of the product.All in all, I am thrilled with my beast of a skillet. The size is great for my large family but if you aren\\'t cooking for a bunch of people I think this skillet may be overkill for you. Try a 12-in or even a 10.5 in. skillet.Edit: I just received the 12-in rooster pan as a gift and I am thrilled! The rooster design adds a homey touch to our otherwise contemporary kitchen. I use the 15 inch skillet every day but it takes up so much room on my stovetop that it is difficult to cook two things at a time. Now I can easily use my 12 inch and 10.5 inch skillets on the stovetop while the big boy 15 incher is baking in the oven. I cannot get enough of cast iron! I\\'ve had this pan for 3 days now, and am very impressed with it. First, it has no teflon-non-stick-who-knows-what-the-heck-that-stuff-can-do-to-you coating on it. I still have to learn the ins and outs of \"seasoning\" a pan. But so far a little spray oil and pancakes come off easy. Once the pan is hot it stays hot. I still have to get used to that. My only complaint is that the handle is a bit short. If the handle were just a few inches longer then it would be perfect. But then again, lots of things would be perfect if it were just a few inches longer.I will probably buy a few more of the same pans in different sizes. This 8\" is a little too small to get a spatula in there to flip pancakes.Update: As of 9/1/2011 I pretty much only use cast iron now. I am gradually switching everything over. I still have some stainless steel pots, but for pans I only use these cast iron ones. I\\'m going to make this short and sweet. It\\'s $16.Season it.Buy a good piece of rib eye.15 minutes later...after the smoke clears...Have a bite of your steak and you\\'ll never pay a premium for restaurant steak again. I too am from the camp of $$$$ Calphalon $$$$ non-stick skillets. I thought... what can be better than that?Originally did not want a cast iron pan because it is not supposed to be washed with soap and water. I can\\'t NOT wash a pan after I\\'m done cooking in it. Fried chicken, eggs, bacon. YUCK! Whip out with a paper towel was just not enough for me.When I use this pan, I let it cool completely. Then, I fill it with hot water and let it soak for about an hour. Then, with an OXO brush (http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Dispensing-Brush/dp/B00004OCLK/) that is filled with SoftSoap, I scrub the pan, and rinse thoroughly, and dry completely with paper towels.  The pan is CLEAN and not greasy.I then spray it lightly with Pam, and put it in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes, then leave the pan to cool in the closed oven. To store this pan, I keep it underneath of my stove (I have the broiler at the bottom of my old fashioned stove) on top of the broiler rack set far from the flame, covered in heavy foil to keep out dust.  This keeps the pan nicely seasoned and bone dry.  Never a problem with rust at all, and it is indeed non-stick.Hamburgers have a wonderful crust, bacon is flat and crispy, eggs flip \"no-yokey-brokey,\" good stuff!!!  And I\\'ve always wanted to use a metal fish turner... but I dare not with Calphalon non-stick pans. You still don\\'t want to scrape the pan with metal, but it is a lot more forgiving than a non-stick surface.I am still holding onto my Le Creuset Dutch Ovens however. :-) But if you are looking for a dutch oven, I\\'d have no problem recommending a Lodge cast iron model.And here is another fantastic bonus:\"Cooking with cast iron fortifies your food with iron. While cast iron doesn\\'t leach chemicals, it can leach some iron into your food...and that\\'s a good thing. Iron deficiency is fairly common worldwide, especially among women. In fact, 10% of American women are iron-deficient. Cooking food, especially something acidic like tomato sauce in a cast-iron skillet can increase iron content, by as much as 20 times.\"SOURCE: [...] This pan is fantastic.  Yes, cast iron is a bit heavy, and you will need a potholder as the handle will get hot as you cook.  The benefits of this wonderful product well make up for those two.  Food tastes great, it is non-stick once properly seasoned, infuses iron into the food (good for you!) and is Made in the USA! Overall, this met our expectations. We needed (er, wanted) a bigger cast iron skillet, so we went looking for one with good reviews and landed here. I was worried about people saying it might crack, etc. So far we have had it work out really well, but I will disclose we did not feel it was really seasoned well. Everything was sticking a LOT, so I just seasoned it with shortening (Google if you don\\'t know how - very easy!), coating the whole pan (and putting a foil-covered cookie sheet below to catch drippings. The first few times, we made sure to cook fatty foods (bacon, ground beef), but now it is seasoned really well so we can just use a bit of spray and make anything - grilled cheese, french toast, veggies - whatever. That\\'s really my only complaint, and as long as you\\'re expecting it, it shouldn\\'t be a deal-breaker. It was an easy fix for an affordable product!Update: 8/22/12: We\\'re using this on average 1-2x/week, and it works great. I have seasoned it a couple of times to get it really good and non-stick. I followed the Martha Stewart cleaning tip - rinse out as much as you can with water, then just add a few drops of water, and rub down the pan with some salt (seriously, thank you Martha! Easiest tip ever!). Rinse, dry and then I pop it back on the stove top on low for about 10 minutes to get any remaining water out (which I learned was critical after a little rust spot appeared). If you have never had a cast iron skillet before, lesson #1 would be DO NOT USE SOAP ON YOU PAN! Seriously though, this was a great buy for us! This is the pan I prefer for high heat searing. The pan came pre-seasoned. However I did re-season it with a little oil and heated it for an hour in the oven. Even so the meat stuck a little on the first use, and non after continued use. My purchase was in January of 2013. This is a good quality item. I have not had any problems with rust.After use, I allow the pan to heat up until it is very hot. I put hot water in it and it self cleans. I then wipe the pan out, oiling it lightly. I keep it stored tied up in an old pillow case with a sheet of paper towel between uses. I highly recommend this product. It\\'s a Lodge so you know it\\'s the best cast iron skillet you can get.  It\\'s just what I expected.  Large, ready to use, and made in the USA.  Love it. I have three of these skillets: 8\", 10\" and 12\". They are absolutely wonderful! I know Lodge recommends no soap, but I use mild soap, anyway. I dry them after washing and when necessary, lightly coat with canola oil from a spray can.I can do anything in my cast iron pans--including flipping an omelet!Nothing beats cast iron for its superior cooking surface. I like to cook at very high temperatures at times, either to sear meat or to caramelize vegetables and nothing handles the heat like cast iron.Be warned, however--this is a heavy pan. I usually scoop food out and place onto a dish. I use two potholders to carry it with both hands to the sink. It\\'s worth the effort.Author of the award winning book,Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet I have had this skillet for two months now and really enjoy working with it. Once I seasoned it (light coating of shortning and in the oven at 325 for one hour and leave there overnight to cool and repeat process one more time), food releases easily and it is a joy to  work with this skillet that heats so evenly and keeps temperature so well. I have made pan pizza in it twice and cooked up skillet potatoes, and chicken and vegetables. It is perfect for dishes going from stovetop to oven and it browns food very nicely. These skillets are such a tremendous bargain for how functional they are.Cleaning and care are a little different than for other cookware but no more difficult. Scrub with a nylon brush or sponge and hot water (dishsoap optional), dry, and season with a light coating of oil and wipe with a paper towel. I\\'m working with cast iron for the first time and this pan is great! I do wish it was easier to clean but I haven\\'t found any cast iron that is. I own the best hard-anodized aluminum pans - Anolon Allure. But this skillet is for high temperature browning without worry. The non-stick coatings, if turned up too high will emit toxic fumes, especially to birds. Cast iron does not.Cooking a steak in a nonstick pan you need to let it soak in water for 10 minutes and then use a non-metal potscrubber brush.Cooking a steak in a nonstick pan you need to let it soak in water for 10 minutes and then use a metal potscrubber brush, then wipe it with a paper towel and place it on a burner for 30 seconds to let any water evaporate. Then very lightly coat it with oil.Also it best for the heat source to be under ALL the surface area of the bottom of the pan. Using an infrared temperature sensor I measured 500 degrees in the center and 300 where the burner was not directly underneath. Again, its important to match the burner diameter to the pans diameter.If you understand these concepts then you will be serving both tasty and healthy food. Go right ahead and use metal cooking utensils too.Lastly, for stovetop use, I love my skillet but not the cast iron lids as i don\\'t want to draw away heat from the cooking area. Instead I use a metal outlined glass lid which took a bit of an effort to match the oddball 10 1/4\" size. Sometime you just need a pan for small task to get the job done. This pan skillet is good for single fast frying dishes (no deep frying) and for preparation such as saut&eacute; for main courses.  It will take a little time before this small Pre-Season Skillet can use normally. It needed to age and will require more seasoning before it can be used comfortably without any concern of rusting. For now it needs to be cleaned and dried after each usage to avoid possible rusting. Oh My God i am a cast iron convert this is my pan of choice now follow the directions and it will be awesome for you mine has hit the &#34;sweet spot&#34; fellow cast iron junkies will know what I mean am in love with this pan.  I even bought a real small one for eggs and small batches of cornbread.Highly recommend After struggling with a set of three regular cast iron pans from a different manufacturer, I finally boxed them up for Goodwill.  I never mastered the seasoning part of cast iron usage.  I ended up with a sticky residue and one pan rusted.  After about three attempts of scouring and reseasoning, I gave up and ordered three Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned skillets.It is fanstastic.  It worked like a charm with the first use -- no problems with sticking at all.  I actually smiled while making my burger!  My cornbread was also back up to Southern standards thanks to my 10-inch pan.The 10-inch works well for cornbread and frying.  (Acutally cast iron is the only way to make good cornbread.)  I use the 8 for single burgers.  The 6 I bought out of habit, but it also works well for single burgers.Clean up is relatively easy.  Wash with hot water; Lodge does not recommend using soap.  Dry thoroughly.  I then heat mine on the stove top, turn off the heat, add a tablespoon of oil and use a paper towel to spread the oil on the entire pan inside and out.  After the pan cools, I wipe away any excess oil and store the pan.For anyone who wants a head start on leaving heirloom cast iron pans, I strongly suggest this product. Had this for over a year now, and it\\'s a true workhorse!  Sear a steak on stove top, then shove the entire pan into oven afterwards.  Perfect steak!No flaws whatsoever, this thing deserves 5 stars.  Just make sure you oil it after each use. Never owned cast iron before. Decided to try this one. It does come pre-seasoned. However, expect stuff to stick a lot the first few uses. Use a metal spatula. After about a dozen uses, it is pretty much non-stick. I bought two Lodge iron skillets, an 8&#34; and a 12&#34;, to replace my Teflon pans. I\\'ve never cooked with iron before, but I have not been disappointed. These pans are clearly good quality heavy duty iron, and they are quite easy to cook with. I was worried the 8&#34; would be a little small, but it has ended up being my go-to pan for a lot of things - the perfect size for heating up corn tortillas, frying side dishes, sauteeing veggies, etc. The 12&#34; I have used less since I generally am only cooking for one or two people, but it\\'s a nice size for a bigger batch of something if I were cooking for friends and family - would be great for making a big batch of home fries or something similar. 10&#34; might be a more versatile size for everyday, depending on your needs, but I like the option of the 12&#34; since I like to entertain. I have been cooking on cast iron for over 20 years. For those unfamiliar with cast iron, you simply dont know what your missing. The flavor is second to none and they are practically indestructible. I only have 2 10\" skillets and I have wanted to buy some new pieces for quite some time. In particular, I have wanted to buy a 12\\' skillet, a dutch oven, and a griddle. I was actually hesitant to buy from Lodge based on the price being so low. How often does something like that happen? Anyways, after doing an ample amount of research I decided to pull the trigger and I ordered 2 pieces, this skillet and the LPGI3 Pro 20\"x10-7/16\" Grill/Griddle. To say I am impressed is a massive understatement, especially when you consider the price. Lodge cast iron could very well be the best deal going in the entire cookware market. I certainly cant think of its equal, at least not that has this price point.My biggest concern was with the pre-seasoning. Its not that big of a deal as seasoning cast iron is very easy but I didn\\'t know if that was something I was going to have to do or not. I was pleasantly surprised. These pans really are ready to go right out of the box. Cast iron has never been this easy. The first thing I cooked was eggs and the flavor was just as good as my 20 year old pans, something I wasn\\'t expecting.For those new to cast iron, just remember a few simple rules and your pans should last forever. When cooking, bring the heat up slowly and if your using a 2 burner griddle make sure you heat both sides evenly even if your only using one side. In regards to cleaning, always hand wash with a stiff nylon brush. Never use detergents or soap and always use hot water as rinsing a hot cast iron pan with cold water can actually cause your pans to crack. Follow these rules and your pans will most likely outlast you.Bottom line - I am absolutely blown away by Lodge Cast Iron. The quality is amazing, the price is amazing and the pre-seasoned pans are literally ready to go right out of the box. Again cast iron has never been this easy. For those that have never tried it, what are you waiting for? At this price point what do you really have to lose? I will be recommending Lodge Cast Iron to everyone I know, right after I order a few more pans.5 Stars and then some!!! This is.the pan that does about 90% of the cooking in our house.  Once you have it fully seasoned, it\\'s hard to get food to stick, which means super-easy cleanup!  I have a mid-range stainless steel multiclad type set that gets a little use, but this is my go-to pan for most cooking.Pros:Conducts heat well.Easy clean up.Can cook on all surfaces, including an open flame (campfire!)Cooks like a charm.Cons:Like all cast iron - no dishwasher!Handle gets hot.  If you need one that the handle doesn\\'t get hot on, look at the newer ones with a stainless handle.Advice:No soap, wash gently in warm water, or you\\'ll remove the seasoning and stuff will stick.Wait to wash, if you try to wash it while it\\'s hot, you will most likely crack the iron.Reseason from time to time.Overall:A hundred years tells the story, your kids kids will be using this pan. The Lodge 8\" serving pot with iron lid is a wonderful compliment to this handy skillet.  The serving pot lid fits the skillet well. My grandparents had Lodge cast-iron cookware and loved it. I made the BIG mistake of trying to save money by buying a different brand several years ago. No matter how much I used it ... no matter how much I seasoned it ... it wasn\\'t the virtually non-stick that I remembered from my grandparents days. I purchased a few pieces from Amazon in mid-March.So far, the 8&#34; skillet has seen the most use. I love it! It is already virtually non-stick! This morning I cooked a sausage patty in it...once the sausage was done, I cooked an egg. The egg did NOT stick!!! I will NEVER buy anything but Lodge brand cast-iron when adding to my small collection. I do have the 5 qt Dutch oven and look forward to fixing a pot roast in it using my gas grill during the summer.All of my &#34;other brand&#34; of cast-iron has been donated to a charity store. I like Lodge cast iron items. I have many diffrent sizes of these work horses. They are versatile; you can fry, saute, roast. They are virtually non-stick in many situations, provided that they are properly seasoned. Although they are preseasoned, I season them again before using them. This process enhances non-stcik prioperties.This particular size is good to sautee small portions of pretty much anything. Highly recommend them. This pan has become my 1st choice for browning or frying...distributes the heat evenly, excellently...i don\\'t have to turn the burner up as high either. I love that its cast iron, us ladies need the extra iron in our diets & this is a good way to get the trace amounts in our diet. Wish i had purchased this a LONG time ago & also wish it had a matching lid, otherwise ITS PERFECT!!! Great little pan for melting butter or cooking eggs. It\\'s the same great quality as the larger lodge skillets. It\\'s too cute to put away. I have it hanging in the kitchen! I ordered it in 2007. It is 2013 now, we still use it very often. Not only good at home, also good for ourdoors cooking. We own several different sizes of Lodge Logic pans. The 12-Inch one is our favorite cast iron pan. Lodge cast iron, what a great thing.Properly seasoned and used its practically as no stick as teflon or hard anodized. Dont expect that overnight it takes multiple uses and seasonings to get it there but when its right and its there, in my opinion it cant be beat!And as for using soap as a no no...........Well that rule was created many moons ago when soap was lye based and yeah it would eat away at your seasoning.But as for a little modern dish DETERGENT (Not dishwasher, but dish) not a problem at all.I use it from time to time if the skillet needs a little help with cleanup and no problems at all.Just clean it up quick and dont let it sit on the iron and it will be fine.After all I really cant think of a health department that would appove a restraunt using the cast iron without cleaning it with detergent!!!!!And start out cooking on low temp and only go up as high as you need to as you learn your skillet. That will help with the initial sticking you may encounter and keep you from burning foods.Once you learn the skillet and how it cooks, higher temps will be fine!! There are many cast iron enthusiasts out there and I\\'m one of them.  However, the maintenance for this item (although it\\'s not that much) can get annoying at times.  The product is an amazing deal - Made in USA, great construction, etc.  Except if you want to spend less time maintaining your skillet, I\\'d recommend a Le Creuset skillet (and not one from Martha Stewart because I believe those are all made in China and I try my best to avoid all food-related items to come from China).  Easy to clean, all the properties of cast iron except for the ridiculous price tag (just snag one when they\\'re on sale). pan- seared a WHOLE chicken oven roaster in this skillet yesterday and what a beautiful crust it gave that bird!!! Not with any other pan EVER did I get such results. Then I transferred it to the oven, unlike before I would have to transfer into another long baking dish... the chicken would never stay intact and I would have more dirty dishes to wash!It was soooooooo delicious! We ate from it till we coldn\\'t eat no more!I anticipate cooking in this one everyday.This skillet is very generous and I did buy the lid for it, that\\'s another story/review..what another great peice to have after you season that big ol\\' lid(comes unseasoned). Helper handle is a must cause it\\'s impossible to carry this skillet with one handle(very heavy alone so with food it weighs a ton!), be careful always to cover the handle after the iron gets hot...ouch!I gotta say I don\\'t know how the heck I was living without cast iron. It did take me a while to get a hang of the seasoning process because even with those preseasoned peices you still really gotta season it yourself to get that non-stick and glossy surface. So after a few episodes of pooling of seasoning and  and trying out different kinds of shortenings and oils and smoke detectors going off, I finally found my own method...I hope you find yours. It\\'s very simple though like I said once you get the hang of it, and the iron just keeps getting better and better and darker and darker. I threw all my non-stick out after all of them warped...and the crazy thing about it is that they were top-of-the-line...triple the cost of iron. I bought them from Macy\\'s, Bloomingdale\\'s ...expensive..make a long story short.I love this pot and with some TLC you will love it too and perhaps give it to someone you really, really,really love after 30 years or so! Nice, heavy skillet!  Perfect for steaks and any other recipes that need to be finished in the oven. Great Skillet... Nothing sticks to it! I am planning to by a bigger one too!Size info:It fits only one egg. If you want to do 2 at a time it gets a little bit more complicated to use. Flipping the two eggs is difficult. I use this thing every day! It\\'s small but is perfect for me. I make eggs on it and other things like veggies. Easy to clean If you want to cook a LOT at one time this is the pan for you. We wanted a big pan to fry large quantities of fish all at once. Everything we\\'ve cooked has browned up beautifully. Would definitely make sure you want a skillet this large. I went to the Lodge factory outlet in South Pittsburg Tn.  This product is American made in a Foundry next to the outlet and employs appx 200 Americans.  There is a 2nds area and this skillet is maybe 10$ cheaper, but when you think about the travel time and gas, plus taxes it is not that much cheaper than Amazon.  Lodge is a quality product, it is a life time product that does not have a chemical coated inside that will scratch when you use metal utensils.  I believe in buying American when at all possible and this is definitely a no brainer when buying cookware. Let\\'s start off with something that is not entirely clear from the description of this Lodge skillet on the Amazon website... the description states that Lodge is an \"American-based company\" but does not expressly state whether this skillet is made in the United States.  It is - the tag on this Lodge skillet states Made in USA.  Why does the description dance around that issue?  Some copy writer needs a new line of work...Next, some people may be trying to decide between Lodge and the Wagner Ware (WagnerWare - American Culinary Cookware) products.  Let me tell you from my personal experience, you may regret it if you decide to order Wagner Ware.  Don\\'t get me wrong, the Wagner Ware product is nice.  However, the company is terrible to do business with.  If your experience is like mine, you will wait and wait and wait for your order to arrive, then try to contact them only to find out that it is impossible to reach somebody when you email or call, and when they finally do respond it will be with excuses about how something you did was not quite right.  Avoid the headaches and get the Lodge now. You will soon be cooking on a very fine skillet that, I can attest, does every bit as good a job as the Wagner Ware.  Plus, no headaches. Fantastic value for a very good pan. We already have an older cast iron skillet that we use all the time, but I decided to buy a second in order to be able to use two at once. To tell the truth, I didn\\'t really NEED a second one, but when I saw the price and the reviews for this one after browsing a friend\\'s Amazon wedding registry, I hit &#34;Buy Now&#34; for us.  I am very happy with that decision. We can even use the silicon handle over on the other pan. I should have bought one for the wedding gift too! Great quality Item. You can feed an army with this pan. You need both hands to handle this pan. It is a good thing there are two handles to lift and move it. My experience (and fried egg experiment) with the \"pre-seasoning\" was similar to those reviewers who have expressed disappointment.  Ignore that this skillet is preseasoned, YouTube how to season and care for cast iron, and you\\'ll ultimately have a good heavy duty reasonably priced cast iron skillet that will last FOREVER.Cast Iron works better the more you use it.  My older larger better used skillets work like this one \"should\" out of the box, but doesn\\'t.  This size is perfect for making cornbread with one box of Jiffy.  Just a few uses in and it is working as promised. This pan has been a joy to use and is in daily use since it arrived.  I was cautious at first, but food really did not stick to the pre-seasoned finish.  My first try was breakfast sausage which developed a delicious crisp crust that I\\'d forgotten meats could have.  About my fourth use I fried an egg which slipped right out of the pan when it was done.  Feeling brave I tried scrambled eggs the next day with just a tiny bit of sticking.  Wahoo!  Better tasting food and easy clean-up, why did I desert cast iron for so many years for the false promises of fragile toxic teflon?The pan has the gritty texture some reviewers mentioned, but it does not affect performance.  It sounds funny when I use a metal (!) utensil.  Lately I haven\\'t even noticed the scraping noise.Cooking directions are slightly different than what I have done in the past, mainly pre-heating at a lower setting.  Clean ups without soap are a surprise, but effective followed by wiping dry and a light spritz of oil.  Often it only needs a wipe off.  Maybe soap is what spoiled my cooking experience in th past, leading me to give away my old skillets to my daughter-in-law.  And it is heavy, almost too heavy for this senior citizen.  Maybe I should have ordered the 8\" pan instead of the 9\" pan.  Still, I give it a five because the heft also gives the pan its great cooking qualities. Okay, I have to admit that from time to time, especially in the summer, I\\'ve been know to slack in my motherly duties and go the quick route of making chili-mac or even... Hamburger Helper for dinner.  When I do so I use this huge cast iron skillet that I got from my grandmother.  I like it because of the even heating and because it holds a pound of hamburger and \\'the box\\' additions.I\\'ve tried making casseroles in my other cookware, but unfortunately they\\'re not of high enough quality and inevitably one corner will burn while the others are fine.  I never have that problem with cast iron: it heats evenly.This large skillet is also great for cooking bacon and eggs, or for hamburgers.  I can put four medium sized burgers in it at one time-- enough for everyone in our family.Wears like ... well, iron.  My skillet like this one has got to be 50 years old will no signs of wear and tear.  Good for weight lifting ;)Pam T~ was the perfect size for my husband and I so we could have leftovers the next day.  Would also be big enough for a family meal. I had an old cast iron pan since college that I kept on my stove and used daily, cleaning the surface sparingly to avoid contact with water.  In a divorce/move, I lost it.  This was my replacement.  It seemed perfect, but after a couple of months of use, it formed a crack this morning while I was cooking pancakes.  Nothing extreme or unusual had been done to the pan; it hadn\\'t dropped, for example, just asked to cook at a medium heat.  This is the end of my love for cast iron, at least for a while.  If you want this pan, Amazon\\'s price is excellent.  But I\\'m moving on. My husband makes all our dinners-- ALL of them.  He loves this skillet.  It is heavy and needs to be washed differently than our other pans, but the food prepared on it is like none other.  This pan does the job others just can\\'t do!  And you can\\'t beat the price.  Try it!! This is the most incredible skillet I have EVER used!  I use it every single day to cook for my large family.Can\\'t believe I \\'fell\\' for the teflon-type or anodized skillets; I was purchasing a new one every 2 or 3 years as they do not stand up to daily use.  The one improvement we made to both our 15-1/4 and 10-1/4 inch Cast-iron Skillets was to subject them to some serious sanding with our orbital sander.  We started with 80 grit and worked up to 220 grit - took more than an hour, but boy was it worth it!  The pan finish is now like glass and is 100% stick free! I really like these Lodge Logic skillets, and this one is no exception. It is heavy, durable, and pretty much perfect for a variety of uses. If you dont know, iron skillets distribute heat evenly along its surface. This makes cooking far more easy to control. There arent hot spots like with aluminum and non stick skillets. Additionally, they are very easy to clean. Simply boil some water and scrub with a soft brush. These, if anything, hearken back to the days of blacksmiths and hand crafterd wares. I have read complaints about eggs sticking and the like. Definitely note that these are NOT non stick skillets, but they are useful for a wide variety of things besides eggs. For example, we heat tortillas in ours, saute our vegetables, make skillet cakes, etc....additionally, they can go from the stovetop into the oven, so if you are, for example, pan frying a steak, you would sear one side, turn it over, then finish in the oven. This is useful for the abovementioned skillet cakes, corn bread, and a wide variety of other things. You are only limited by your imagination when it comes to these iron skillets.Enjoy! The only reason I didn\\'t give this thing 5 stars is because 1) it doesn\\'t come with the lid and 2) I noticed that it doesn\\'t tend to diffuse heat very well.  Obviously, it\\'s not an all clad copper core pan, but I would have expected pancakes to at least cook up more evenly than they did.  Eggs are great in it.  Couldn\\'t wait to make chicken pot pie in it.  All in all, I\\'m extremely happy with it.  It\\'s solid, well made and it does perform well. This is the only pan I own, that\\'s how good it is. I\\'ve got some other appliances (blender, toaster, electric kettle, etc.), but this is my only pan. Seriously. I have 2 pieces of Lodge cast iron cookware. This one and the 12\" un-preseasoned skillet which I conditioned myself. I have to add my voice to the chorus of cast iron admirers who don\\'t know how they ever survived without their Lodges. I do about 80% of my cooking with one or the other. Steaks, burgers, any type of sauteed chicken recipe, stir-fry, fajitas, cornbread, bacon and eggs, pancakes, french toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, and on and on.Cast iron\\'s chief strength comes from its massiveness. It is basically a honkin\\' big hunk of iron formed into a cooking utensil. This large quantity of metal, once heated, will tend to evenly distribute its heat and stay hot no matter what you put into it. Futhermore, once properly conditioned (which Lodge has done for you here), they are almost as non-stick as teflon.Unfortunately, cast iron is not without its faults. Its greatest strength may also be its greatest weakness in that it is significantly heavier than other types of cookware. This skillet weighs about 6 lbs. Imagine trying to pick that up, plus the weight of whatever you\\'ve cooked in it, with one oven-mitted hand so that you can use a spoon in the other hand to help maneuver your recipe into a serving dish or storage container! If you have weak hands or arthritis or any condition that limits your ability to pick up and manipulate heavy objects, it may not be a good choice for you.Also, iron will rust if not maintained correctly. Lodge provides you with use and care instructions which are not complicated or difficult, but which you MUST follow to the letter. Read the instructions carefully when you get your pan. No dishwasher, no soap (just hot water and a stiff brush), dry quickly and coat with cooking oil.I\\'ve read some reviews where folks are saying that you can\\'t cook tomato-based or acidic products in cast iron. Though it may be true, I\\'ve never found an authoritative source to corroborate this and, in fact, Lodge\\'s website (lodgemfg.com) offers recipes that contain tomatoes and acidic ingredients! I regularly put tomatoes, tomato sauce, wine, lemon juice, etc. in my cast iron and haven\\'t seen any ill effects from doing so.These pans are so inexpensive, it will cost you very little to give them a try. If you do, you\\'ll be singing their praises with the rest of us! I deliberately waited to review this product, because there are so many reviews which praise or dismiss cast iron within a few days or weeks of them using it for the first time.  So please take this review from someone who had the patience to experiment with the pros and the cons.Personally, I feel that cast iron, in general, is fantastic, because it will last for several life times if taken care of properly.  In addition, it doesn\\'t have Teflon, which is becoming a constant concern for those who know better.Pros:It is durable for decades, if not centuries, IF CARED FOR PROPERLY.It distributes heat more evenly.It retains heat longer than other cookware.Once well seasoned, it almost takes care of itself.If you have a recipe that requires you to start the meal on the burner, then transfer it to the oven, this is perfect, since you don\\'t have to worry about some plastic or silicone handle grip melting in the oven.  Just remember to have an oven mitt when handling.Cons:It\\'s heavy.  People with arthritis, or some other physical impairment may have a problem with its weight.There is a learning curve, which takes some getting use to, because of the fact that it retains heat more evenly, and retains it.Un-learning how to clean your cookware can be counterintuitive.  Don\\'t soak it, don\\'t use soap, and don\\'t scour it.  (It removes the seasoning that makes cast iron so great and virtually nonstick.)The 10.25 inch skillet is deep enough, in my opinion, to be more of a pan, and not a skillet.  This is the one item that I bought later than any of my other cast iron purchases, but it is the one pan that I use more than anything else.  After a good 8-9 months of use, it almost maintains itself.  I\\'ve even gone so far as to bring it to a family cook out, and told no one to touch it or clean it.  I didn\\'t want them to get burned from the heat retention, or ruin it with soap and a scouring pad.  And regarding it\\'s cleaning, I strongly recommend AGAINST getting a fancy 8-12 dollar scrubber.  Realistically, while the cast iron will probably outlive you, these cleaning brushes will get gunked up rather quickly.  Even high pressure water blasting can only clean these to a certain, but not total, degree.  So I recommend getting one from a big box store, or even a dollar store.  I go through one of these every few months, and spending 8-12 bucks on one of them is simply nonsensical.MY BOTTOM LINE:  If you\\'re willing to put a little more time in cookware that will take care of your culinary needs, as long as you take care of it, then buy this.  Yes, you\\'ll have to do some small amount of rethinking how you cook, but ultimately, anyone who is passionate about cooking will appreciate cast iron.  But, if you want a light weight, easy to maintain even for a five year old, then cast iron products may not be for you.I\\'d appreciate any questions or comments, so please feel free to ask me anything about cast iron products.  And if I was helpful, please give me a positive vote, and of course, I\\'ll address your comments and concerns when you post them.Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I\\'ve been looking for a small skillet that wasn\\'t coated with teflon for quite some time.  This is just what I\\'ve been seeking.  Here\\'s my take on this little gem:Pros:Just the right size for a single egg for breakfast or for cooking a small amount of onions or just about anything that would be too small in quantity to cover the bottom of an 8\" skillet.  Hooray!Preseasoned pan with no teflon.  Coat with olive oil after each use and you\\'re good to go.  The problems with teflon are well known, but manufactures persist in using this toxic material to make pans non-stick.  This pan is also non-stick but lacks the toxic residue possible from teflon-coated pans.  Double hooray!Cons:You\\'ve got to be a little more thoughtful about caring for this skillet than you are with the pans that are found in most grocery and big-box stores.  But that care requires more thoughtfulness than a big investment of time.Conclusion:For small jobs, this is the pan.  No toxic residue, no overcooked items . . . fills the bill exactly.Five stars! I bought a 15&#34; skillet because of the $24 price at the time.  These things are great for cooking 3-4 steaks at one time or a huge pan of onions/peppers/fried chicken.If you have a nice gas stove and feed 4+ people regularly, get this 15&#34; skillet.  It will get the job done. Yup, it is non stick. Before using it I\\'d coated it w/ canola oil and baked @450\\' for an hour, then left it sit in the cooling oven over night before opening the oven door. Yea, it smelled like hot iron so I opened a window.  I used it the next day to bake beans, and they did not stick.  I repeated the same coat\\'n bake, and leave over night to cool. then the next thing I cooked was  peach cobbler and had no problem with sticking. The pan has a glassy coating after two treatments and two uses and does not have to be treated again. Now after rinsing with hot water (no soap) I dry it with a dish towel, rub a dab of oil around it before putting it away. Canola oil works better than olive oil for the treating because it can take the higher temp and is thinner.I can\\'t go 5 stars because the pan is heavy...but that\\'s the nature of cast iron...takes two hands to lift.I also have an enameled Le Creuset skillet but I like the straight sides of the Lodge better. Go figure. I\\'ve been wanting to buy this skillet for many months now, particularly when I\\'ve read how nonstick pans have a coating that eventually leaches into your food.  I have to admit, I was not attracted by the look of the pan, but did not want to shell out large amounts of money for the higher-end enamel skillets.  At under $20, I could not justify not trying it.  Wow, am I glad that I bought this pan!  It sears meat like a dream, but still keeps it tender!  On my nonstick pans, if I tried to sear meat, they turned out tough and dry from overcooking.  My onions and garlic cook up beautifully without looking burned.  I have not had mine long enough to be able to cook an egg without having the egg stick, but my rice no longer sticks when I make fried rice.  (I once had an aluminum wok that was well seasoned from years of use and I could cook eggs without them sticking, so I know one day, I\\'ll get that with this cast iron.)  Seasoning is easy.  After I clean the pan with hot water and a brush, I dry it with a towel. I then use a pastry brush and brush a little oil on the pan, put it on the burner and turn the heat to medium high.  I let the pan sit until it stops smoking, let it cool and the pan is ready for its next use.  The smoking is not an awful acrid, burning smell so I\\'m not bothered by it.  I just turn on the ventilation fan and that works well enough to keep my house from looking and smelling like I burned bacon.  This pan is going to outlast all my other pans, and the beauty of it is that it is supposed to get better with age, not worse! I had my doubts, but I bought my wife 2 of these pots for Christmas and she absolutely LOVED them!!!! What could go wrong with an iron skillet? It\\'s a great size for many recipes, well made and seemed well sized on delivery but I re-sized it myself. Had it several months and will probably have it forever! Cast iron cookware has excellent heat retention properties and can be produced and formed with a relatively low level of technology. Seasoning is used to protect bare cast iron from rust and to create a non-stick surface. And, in the past ten years the popularity of cast iron pans has increased every year. It is reasonably priced, easy to cook with and the food  tastes delicious. The most popular, and it seems, the last producer of good cast iron pans is Lodge. Based in Tennessee, the company has a superb reputation.Cast iron cookware needs to be seasoned and \\'barefoot Bob\\' who has a popular review here seems to know the ins and outs, so follow his instructions. As reported this pre-seasoned pan tends to stick,,and with the use of any acidic product like tomatoes,the seasonng will go with the wind. Thus is the perfect pan, heart resistant handle that can and should be removed in hot ovens. Once seasoned, cook to your heart\\'s delight, and then wash with water,mdomypu if you like. The perfect pan for the perfect meal.Recommended. prisrob 06-30-14 I got this for my son who enjoys cooking and kept asking where he could get a cast iron skillet.  So.....I surprised him with this and he loves it.  This is now his favorite pan in his kitchen. The ultimate in non-stick cookware! American made Lodge cast iron is simply the best to cook with and is amazingly easy to maintain. Once you get used to it, you don\\'t want to use anything else. I have gotten rid of all my Teflon non-stick and don\\'t even use my All-Clad cookware anymore. The 15&#34; is great for fried chicken and preparing large portions for any meals. The pan had a pit (-one star), surface is not super smooth and like other reviewers have said the preseasoning is a joke.  Still, my love is undaunted.  Seasoning is easy.  After cleaning with hot water and a scrubby brush, I just place it on the stove on low, and rub some on the surface with a paper towel. Easy cheezy lemon peely.  Makes the best fried eggs and fried rice. For my Chinese compatriots, you can get a nice wok char off of this baby. I love that I can turn the electric stove up to high and watch the pan smoke, unlike those fancy schmancy non-stick Circulon and Analon pans that have a max of tolerance of med high.  I don\\'t care what they say about their magic heat conduction properties, medium high on non stick is NOT the same as high on a cast iron. Still using a bit of oil before cooking things so not yet non-stick, but it makes cooking a joy. For the first time, the puppy lingers by the kitchen when Mommy\\'s cooking. Bought for just under $19 for a 12\".  It\\'s a beautiful thing.  Seriously contemplating the 7 quart dutch oven to get a lid that will fit both the 12\" skillet and the 7 quart dutch oven. Refuse to pay more for the lid than I did for the skillet.  That\\'s just silly. I\\'ve been using Lodge cast iron skillets for many years and I\\'ve found they\\'re in fact \"pre-seasoned\" but never to my standards. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars since I don\\'t feel they do a good enough job of pre-seasoning and they play up the pre-season aspect when they market these pans. I wish they would give full disclosure and make it very clear to people that a truly well seasoned pan can\\'t be achieved in the factory because most consumers will confuse \"pre-seasoned\" with \"well seasoned\" and then will expect the same degree of non-stick from pre-seasoned pans that you can\\'t get until or unless it is well seasoned (which can take 10 to 30 uses).Properly pre-seasoning any pan is simple as long as you have a large oven. These instructions also work perfectly for carbon steel. Carbon steel has been long used to make woks and is now becoming popular in making fry pans and skillets. Just remember carbon steel is fragile and can shatter like stoneware if dropped or mishandled, but make great natural and relatively light-weight non-stick cookware.PRE-SEASONING ANY CAST IRON:Heat your pan. This opens the pores of the metal so it can absorb more oil than if it were cold. Be careful, it will be hot as you handle it.... Coat the hot pan liberally inside and out with lard or vegetable oil (must be oil that can be used in high heat frying). Some people also use Crisco or peanut oil. I prefer to use organic corn, safflower, or sunflower oil. I do not recommend using any oil that is not designated for use with high heat as it will cause burning and give off gases that are not good for you to breathe in.... Coating \"liberally\" means use MORE than enough to wet the entire surface, enough so the oil soaks into the pores of the metal until the metal cannot absorb any more oil. Then and only then do you wipe off any excess oil that may drip or cause dripping. This does not mean wipe it completely dry, just make sure there will be no dripping of excess oil once you put it in the oven. Now place your skillet/pan upside down in your oven at high temperature (300F to 500F, your preference, I like 350F for cast iron and 450F for carbon steel) for at least one hour. This bakes in a \"seasoning\" that protects the pan from rust and eventually provides a stick-resistant surface. Be sure to place a sheet of aluminum foil under the pan or on a lower rack, to catch drippings. Let cool to room temperature in the oven.... In my opinion doing it this way is much better than the thin layer of oil sprayed on at the factory. Doing it this way at home makes it more \"non-stick\".CLEANING CAST IRON:Cleaning affects past and future seasoning. Seasoning is not done just at the start, when the pan is new. Seasoning is done every time you use your pan/skillet. Seasoning is done every time you add oil, either when cooking or after cleaning. Seasoning is also done while cooking, as some foods add to the non-stick of the pan and to the flavor of the foods you cook over the years. To preserve and create better seasoning you must clean your cast iron correctly, never using soap. And re-season (dry, heat, and oil it) periodically. I coat my skillets with a thin layer of oil after I clean them - every time I clean them. I clean them with hot water and a very stiff brush, I dry with a cotton towel, heat up to make sure all the water evaporates, add a thin coating of oil. Only then do I consider it ready to sit until the next time it will be used. Just cleaning it with hot water and drying with a towel is not enough, in my opinion, because residual water that soaks into the cast iron can cause rust, even though you can\\'t see it. This will eventually cause sticking.USING CAST IRON:I coat my cast iron pans with oil after cleaning AND just before cooking. I coat it with oil then wipe the oil out. As long as you wipe it out the small amount of oil that clings to the pan will NOT have an adverse effect on your health (if you\\'re trying to avoid cooking with oil). This small amount of oil is just enough to help keep food from sticking. It does this by filling the pores of the metal.The whole idea of seasoning is to make sure oil is absorbed into the pores of the metal, not that you need the oil to cook your food. You can use extra oil to cook your food if you want, but with a well-seasoned pan very little added oil will be needed. I know of no pan that comes seasoned that much. It\\'s always a process of using the pan over and over that gets it to true \"non-stick\". The more often you use and season your pan the smoother the surface will get and the more non-stick it will get. Be patient. It can take 10, 20, or more uses (with proper washings and proper seasonings) before you see a nice smooth surface that is truly non-stick. You\\'ll know you\\'re achieved great seasoning when small drops of water or oil roll around in your pan like drops of rain on a well waxed car.PS) Some say frying a cup or more of chives in oil in your newly seasoned pan will help it become slicker faster (enhancing non-stick properties). Rub the chives into your pan as you fry them. I\\'ve done this with my carbon steel wok and it was fabulous - super slick and non-stick. It will also make the metal darker, and this will tell you it\\'s getting better seasoned.* For full disclosure:I did not buy my 8 inch Lodge skillet from Amazon but I wish I did. I\\'ve purchased other Lodge skillets through Amazon and directly from Lodge, but I was in a hurry to get this 8 inch pan (I needed it that day for a dinner party) so I purchased from Fred Meyer and I paid over $16. I wish I was not in a hurry because I belong to Amazon Prime and I would have gotten it for $10.97 and free shipping which is cheaper than getting it anywhere I know of, even cheaper than getting it from Lodge. I really like knowing that I finally have a cast iron skillet. I was kind of intimidated about caring for it but so far I haven\\'t had much of an issue. I use coconut oil to keep it seasoned. It sure is heavy, makes it kind of difficult for me to drain grease out of it, but that\\'s what husbands are for! I already have a large cast-iron pan and a tiny one, so I wanted one that is medium sized to make a few eggs for breakfast. This one is perfect. I started using cast-iron as an alternative to non-stick and aluminum pans when I found out the dangers of using such pans. Now I only use stainless steel and cast-iron and this one is a great one. a wonderful cast iron pan.  great for pasta, large skillet dishs.wish I had a cover. I was looking on Amazon.com to buy a gift for my daughter\\'s boyfriend, who was learning to cook. Last Christmas we bought him his first cast iron piece, a Lodge 12\" cast iron skillet. He later told me it was the best Christmas present he had ever gotten in his entire life. He uses it daily, and continues to rave about it. I was looking on Amazon.com for a 5qt. Lodge dutch oven to get him for his birthday, but as I scrolled through the Lodge cast iron cookware and passed the Lodge 12\" skillet, I noticed it was on sale for $15.90, with free shipping. I already own a Lodge 12\" cast iron skillet, but for that low price, now I have two. I may just save it to give as a gift sometime down the line. In reality, the Lodge cast iron skillet is a rarity, an excellent value at it\\'s normal retail price. But when you can find it on sale for about half of the normal retail price, then it\\'s a steal. The skillet will last a lifetime, with minimal care, and actually get better the more you use it. It\\'s one of those rare items that actually gives you value for your money. Think of how many meals will be made over the course of a lifetime with a Lodge cast iron skillet, for the price of a single fast food meal for two. By the way, I also found the 5qt. Lodge dutch oven for the lowest price I have ever seen on Amazon.com, and purchased it too. First time using cast iron pan. I decided to buy Lodge seasoned cast iron 12\" pan because it is USA made, reasonable price, and many great reviews. I followed the instructions to season it again and clean the pan, it is so easy! The cast iron pan does need a little more oil than the non-stick pan. When doing stir-fry, the meat stick to the pan a little. Just add a little water, the meat will come off the pan easily. Cast iron pan is heavy compared to my non-stick aluminum pans, but will take iron in my food anytime than aluminum. The handle is shorter than my regular pans, and the handle can get very hot during cooking. Will definitely be helpful to have a handle cover. I love my Lodge pans. The only reason I hesitate to give them a 5-star rating s because of minor manufacturing impurities/defects present in the pan that you don\\'t find in more expensive brands. But for the price, Lodge is the best price-performance product that still exceeds minimum standards of excellence to be used in a master chef kitchen.The 10.5&#34; pan itself is about 5 pounds. If you are not used to sturdy cookware, this may seem heavy, but if you want the best, you may find this to be the optimal balance between sufficient cooking mass to retain and distribute heat, and being still light enough to hold in one hand. I also bought the 15&#34; and 6&#34; pans. The 15&#34; is too big for my stove and way too heavy to hold in one hand. The 6&#34; pan is light, but a little too small for many cooking jobs. If I had to do it over again, I would have bought the 10.5&#34; before anything else, then eventually the 6&#34;.Haven\\'t had any issues with rusting, though I always wash, dry, and slightly reheat after each use. Rub a little cooking oil on at the end of each use, too. The only time I wish I had a stainless steel pan is for frying eggs or fish, which are both very difficult to scrape of the pan (and don\\'t need the heating properties of cast iron, anyway). I have several number 12 Lodge cast iron skillets. I use them all the time and love them . If you treat them right you will be very happy with this skillet. Proper cleaning with only HOT water and a brush then wipe clean and dry with paper towel. I then put alittle and I mean very little like a film of shortening back on the pan.Then store it till you use again. Don\\'t leave in  water for long periods of time, just a quick hot water wash. Another point for non stick is to get the skillet HOT first then add oil and cook your egges ect...!Cast iron the first NON STICK finish and my opinion is its the best. I have had many other cookware pans but I always go back to cast iron.Lodge is best I can find on the market today! Made in the USA. This pan has worked really well for several recipes on the stove top and outside. We really like it and have recommended it as a good value I didn\\'t know what pre-seasoned meant. Surprisingly, oil is somehow baked into the finish of the cooking surface of the cast iron allowing you to cook foods and not worry about the food becoming hopelessly stuck to the pan.I love that I can get this pan HOT and not worry about what\\'s going to happen to the cooking surface. I love it for searing when I cook. The pan imparts more of a grilled look and taste to meats than I\\'ve been able to achieve in my non-stick pans.This pan is tough and will last as long as I do.So far, the pan hasn\\'t been horribly sticky and it\\'s a breeze to clean with the polycarbonate pot scrapers. I don\\'t use soap to clean it. If it\\'s really badly baked on I put water in the pan and return it to a burner. Turn up the heat and simmer some of the food off. I then quickly scrape with the scrapers, rinse a few times, dry, lightly coat cooking surface with cooking oil and put it away. For the price you can\\'t go wrong with giving it a try and I think you will probably love it! I bought this for my mom of 70 yrs old. She is from the old school of ALWAYS cooking jn a cast iron skillet. Well, she just loves this skillet. She said it is true, that it does come Pre-Seasoned. The extra handle for lifting/pouring made her day. She said this will help so much with her weak arms. She cannot wait to make her cornbread :-) As I have said in my other reviews...I LOVE cast iron cookware and I love Lodge. My grandmother used cast iron and so do I. The pros are numerous: it\\'s durable, easy to clean and maintain, it cooks evenly, and will last you literally FOREVER with proper care. This little skillet is great for sauteing mushrooms, onions or vegies. Cooking a small batch of cornbread and actually it\\'s great for just about anything! I have several sizes of Lodge skillets from 8\" to the granddaddy 17\" inch size, griddles, loaf pans, pizza pans, etc. And all of them perform wonderfully! I can\\'t say enough great things about Lodge! This pan has good dimensions.  I was skeptical about the pre-seasoning, but its done excellently and the pan cooks great out of the box. I bought this because of Alton Brown\\'s rave reviews and was not at all disappointed. I would have preferred the 10 inch pan only because this one is so heavy and probably takes longer to heat up than the smaller one. Don\\'t worry about the pre-seasoned or original finish, it is really easy to season it yourself. I bought this preseasoned one but seasoned it anyways before I used it because it looked a little chipped.4 stars, only because of the size. It\\'s fantastic that such a great way for cooking meat is so highly recommended by chefs and foodies everywhere yet is still so affordable and accessible to everyone.The Lodge Logic cast iron skillets are amazingly solid and heavy skillets that are pre-seasoned and coated so they are ready to use and grill.These things literally last for years and have the important characteristic of getting extremely hot compared to an ordinary pan that will do wonders for your steak cooking.A few notes/advice:1) Don\\'t put a lot of oil on this.  A tiny bit is fine, but the char and coating of the skillet add to the flavor of the steak.2) Don\\'t use soap to clean this.  Just water.  It\\'s a bit harder to get the grease out, but it will be fine.3) Finally, allow the item to completely dry and wipe it dry.  I made the mistake of not doing so and the cast iron can quickly rust.  In most cases, the rust can be scrubbed off, but after a few times it can definitely be an issue and I bought a new one.4) These are great for placing in ovens.  But they get very hot.  If you are gonna handle when it is hot, definitely use something like anOve\\' Glove Hot Surface Handler, 1 Glove (Pack of 2)or theLodge ASHH11 Silicone Hot Handle Holder, Blackfor safety. Bought this skillet at the same time I bought the 10 1/2 \" skillet and the review would be basically the same as I wrote for the other one.  This one holds 6 extra large eggs at one time and they come out perfectly every time.  My two Shih Tzu\\'s will attest to that as when we have eggs, they sit there and wait till they are done and get their egg for the week!  Wonderful product! This is my first cast iron skillet. After trying it out for a couple of months, I totally love it.I find it perfect for cooking one or two eggs in the morning. Because it\\'s so small, it\\'s not too heavy at all. So if you don\\'t like the weight of cast iron cookware, this one is not a problem.Things like eggs got sticky at the beginning, but after several times of use, it became as easy as non-stick skillets. Even better, I use less oil to cook eggs with this skillet. A very thin layer of oil will do the job. Things taste same or less greasy, and it feels much healthier. I wish I had discovered cast iron sooner. I had no idea it was as non-stick as it is, and frying ANYTHING is so much easier now. It holds heat so well I can finally get a nice sear on a steak with my old weak stove burner. My old pans lose heat so I usually end up poaching the meat in it\\'s juice. This stay hot enough to do it right. My wife loves this pan. It\\'s a plus that this pan already comes pre-seasoned. It\\'s a bit heavy but hey it\\'s cast iron. This is a good value as these last forever with proper care not like the teflon coated pans which are dangerous to use when the coating eventually starts peeling (poison).Her only recommendation is to clean and dry it as soon as it cools.It becomes harder to clean if you let pan greases sit in it over night.If you lose the shine on this just coat it with a little vegetable oil and leave it in the oven with the pilot light on for a couple of days and it will be good as new. For the first few times I used this 9&#34; skillet, I had to scrape the bottom hard to keep food from sticking and burning.  Then, after a few more times of use and proper cleaning, it began to get easier where the food didn\\'t stick as much as it did at first.  Finally, after using this skillet 8 times and cleaning it properly, food no longer sticks to it!! It works as if it was a teflon skillet, so now I\\'m happy with it.  The proper way I was told to clean it was let it cool after use (obviously), use a Scotch-Brite sponge and warm water to clean it, then use a paper towel to absorb all the water from its surface, then lightly coat the entire inside with olive oil (or whatever oil you like to use) and let it sit this way until you are ready to use it again.  This procedure seems to work perfectly!  The only con about this skillet is that it has a rough surface on the inside, Lodge could have made this a lot smoother than it is, but overall doesn\\'t seem to matter too much as, again, it now works like a teflon skillet. Highly recommend this skillet! As a first time cast iron owner, I need directions for maintnenance.  When I cooked a marinated steak in the pan, the marinade stuck to the pan.  No idea how to get it off without hurting the pan or the finish. It is heavy and cooks well, just need to know how to clean it. Nothing lightweight about this cast-iron skillet. I use it primarily for frying and it maintains the heat perfectly for large batches of fish or chicken. I was happy when it came and I realized how wide this was; it almost needs two burners. I also own the 12 inch skillet which is great. Pre-seasoning makes this brand my favorite. It\\'s priced right and comes with free shipping from Amazon. I opened it up and it was beautiful.  Great quality, great finish.  It\\'s going to be around for a very long time. This is my first cast iron pan (that I\\'ve owned, I mean--I do have some experience with them), after years of dealing with aluminum and some stainless steel. This is probably the best-priced cast iron pan you can find, and it\\'s working great for me so far. It comes pre-seasoned and is fairly simple to keep seasoned if you follow some guidelines. Avoiding metal scrubbers and harsh soaps (including dishwashers) is good advice since both can remove the seasoning. Lodge\\'s website recommends washing with no soap if you know your pan got hot enough to sanitize anything on it, but they do say mild soap can be OK if you\\'re really concerned about it. I\\'ve usually used no soap myself. They also recommend coating with a light coat of vegetable oil after each use (but I\\'ve seen some people recommend against this in case it turns rancid, though if you use it frequently it may not matter). Basically, I recommend following the manufacturer\\'s instructions if you\\'ve never used these before since they might be different from what you\\'re used to.One note: the entire pan is cast iron, including the handle. Since this is not insulated, you\\'ll want to remember to use a pot holder or slip on a silicone or other protective pan handle cover on it. These pans are also somewhat heavy, but there is a small grip on the side opposite the handle as well, which helps to lift then pan for pouring or whatever (again, you\\'ll need a potholder). There is a lip/spout on side of the pan that can help with this, although I\\'ve never cooked something liquid enough for it to be useful for me. I\\'ve used mine exclusively on the stovetop, but they are also versatile in that they can be used in the oven or just about any heat source (campfire, etc.) except a microwave.In summary, this is a great pan, and it\\'s quickly become my favorite skillet. It is a bit heavy (hard to lift with one hand while trying to scrape the contents into a bowl, for example), but that\\'s the case with pretty much any good cast iron pan and something I\\'m learning to work around better. I hope it lasts for years and years, and I highly recommend reading the manufacturer\\'s instructions if you\\'ve never used one before. Their website is also full of information. This makes everything taste better. A great value. Just be sure not to wash it! If mine gets a little too dirty, I\\'ll scrape with the Lodge scraper, coat with canola oil, heat up a bit, then mop up with paper towels. That gets it clean, and extra seasoned. These skillets are great for a fried egg, and I really mean \\'A\\' fried egg but they are better for using to serve appetizers in.  Cheese spreads, tapas, let your imagination run wild and your family and guests will love them. To start, I did preseason the pan in the oven for 3 hours, twice.  Inside and out - spread a high smoke point oil (like peanut oil) with a paper towel - then put in the oven upside down to keep oil from pooling.  Put down a layer of aluminum foil below if you\\'re concerned about drips.I\\'ve used the pan a dozen times or so, and have never had a sticking problem, or any difficulty cleaning it.  The first time, I did see a hint of rust on the bottom inside of the pan the next day, so now I spritz it with a bit of Pam before I hang it on my pot rack.  Problem solved.  By the way, know your  your pot rack - this pan is heavy!The pan excels in searing. I cooked some lean pork loin chops and they turned out much better than any other method (grilling, broiling, pan frying with a normal pan).  There is a nice golden sear out the outside which looks like something you\\'d get in a restaurant.  I\\'m still a big fan of grilling for most meats, but this is a nice alternative for very lean meats.  I will be trying chicken this way soon.I\\'ve noticed this pan cooks on a lower heat setting.  I found my simmer was a low boil when leaving something to cook for 1/2 hour.  The food was a bit too soft.This pan is not good for sauteeing chef style (where you flip the pan by hand), as it\\'s just too heavy for that.Best tools/methods:Preseason it.Pam (for storage and cooking).  Pam is basically spray canola oil.Pot scrubber sponge without soap (for cleaning). This pan is heavy and requires a bit of extra care to ensure it doesn\\'t rust, but it cooks very evenly, holds its heat extremely well, is made in the U.S.A., and will become a family heirloom. it does the work that you would expect for a cast iron skillet. nice size and cures easily. this is somewhat heavy. I use this pan for almost everything. It will definitely rust if you leave any type of wet food or liquid in it for more than ten minutes, but that\\'s easy to clean off with a bit of oil and some kosher salt wiped around with paper towels. We bought this pan over two years ago.  It is now one of the most used pans in our kitchen.  We have cooked everything from bacon, Italian and breakfast sausages, steaks, caramelized onions, sauces-cooked stove top, to chicken pot pie, cornbread, rolls,cake-baked in oven.  We\\'ve seared meat on top of the stove, then transferred it to the oven to finish cooking.Everyone needs this pan in their kitchen as a kitchen basic! It\\'s a big skillet, made of cast-iron.  It arrives \\'pre-seasoned\\', but will improve as they do with true seasoning I am sure.  I bought the 15&#34; pan because \\'bigger is better\\', and it cost the same or less than the 12&#34;.  If I were to do it over, I would have purchased the 12&#34; skillet for the simple reason that this 15&#34; skillet is one heavy dude.  Seriously you might sprain a wrist lifting it one handed if you are not careful.  I may purchase a  10&#34; or 12&#34; and have two on hand.  If I do, I will most likely use the smaller skillet on more of a day-to-day basis. I don\\'t think you could do much better for any amount of money.  This skillet well made and well finished.  My wife and I have a good relationship; but after receiving this skillet I am going to make sure it stays that way.  One solid swing and  the person on the receiving end would hear the singing of angels for eternity. Everytime I cook something for friends they all want one.  Clearly one of the best items I\\'ve ever purchased on Amazon.  For the money, you just cannot beat the quality!  I use it everyday! I love this pan and use it frequently. I don\\'t have issues with maintaining the season or with the heating up time, etc. I wish i had a good lid for it,  and i rusted it very slightly on the bottom trying to clean it over just a few hours, but that\\'s easy to fix. I recommend this item. Two of my daughters will be moving into apartments this fall when they head back to college.  They asked me what they would need for their kitchen, so I got them each 2 skillets -- an 8&#34; and a 10&#34;.  It told them that should cover most of their needs.  I don\\'t think even a college kid could destroy these. This tiny skillet fits in the palm of your hand.  I wasn\\'t too sold on it until I found the ultimate use for it.  Roasting garlic.You fill the tiny pan with peeled cloves of raw garlic, shoot in some olive oil and a pinch of salt, and put it on low heat.  The garlic cooks in the tiny oil bath yielding awesome roasted garlic, as well as delicious garlicy olive oil.I\\'m buying these for stocking stuffers this year. Lodge Logic makes the best cast iron products for the best price. I had a 10&#34; pre-seasoned skillet that worked wonderfully but now I have upgraded to a 12&#34;! Can you say GIANT PANCAKE??? I didn\\'t see the lid at the time I ordered it.  I\\'m not sure it was available but I was pretty thorough.  I think I would have seen it.  Now I see the lid and it basically makes this a low profile Dutch Oven.  Buy it once and you are set in case of foreign invasion and you have to live in the woods like Red Dawn.  Excellent weapon too or you can drop it on enemies from trees and win even easier. I bought this with the idea of using it for frying an egg or two, since eggs stick to my stainless pans. If you have the same idea, don\\'t buy this! Buy a teflon coated one instead. My old teflon pan was ideal for frying eggs; they slide right off. Since eggs stick, you will have to use a spatula to get the eggs out. But this skillet is too small and the sides too high to allow easy flipping with a spatula. And then the cleaning...this pan does not have a mirror surface, rather a porous one. Eggs get stuck in the pores and don\\'t clean off easily. Straightforward cast iron skillet. Strong, sturdy, thick, with two handles for easier and safer handling.  The pretreatment is better than nothing, but it does still requires some seasoning, or at least some regular use for awhile before it reaches full seasoning, so don\\'t be surprised if things stick a little in the beginning despite the pretreatment.  Cast iron gets better with time with a lot of use, as long as one doesn\\'t use soap.  Easy to clean while still hot or warm with only hot water and a stiff brush.  If food is allowed to cool in it and it is stuck on, it is still easy to clean with hot water, a stiff brush, and a little elbow grease. I would give it five stars but I\\'ve noticed all of my newer Lodge cast iron pans are not exactly flat like the old ones. They aren\\'t horribly misshapen, but liquids and oils do run to one side despite my stove being level and that means the pans themselves are not level.  They are very useable but since they are not entirely level, they do not deserve five stars. This pan is the perfect size for my household.  The small handle opposite the main handle makes it much easier to pick up, because, like all cast iron pans, it is heavy.  I love that it is pre-seasoned.  Care for it as recommended, and it will truly last a lifetime. This skillet is turning out to be a very handy addition to my large (and growing) collection of Lodge Logic cast iron.It\\'s a great size to fry a couple of eggs (and since a lid from another set of cookware fits, I can poach the eggs in this skillet too), reheat a single portion of leftovers, or bake up that cup or two of leftover batter (so who wants to pop the muffin pan back into the oven for such a small amount?).All in all, a great little pan!  Thanks, Lodge. I love iron skillets and love to share them with people, for a modern iron skillet these are actually pretty decent...normally I have an issue with pre-seasoned but these are actually usable as is. I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. In fact I love it to and I find myself using this more then she does, we rarely even use our other pans. There is tons of space on this thing and its a very well made product. If you clean these PROPERLY they will never crack and last forever. Lighter than the 12&quot; pan - still works great.  By getting the Pre-Seasoned version, you don\\'t have to worry about being extra careful with your first few uses.  Retains heat very well. This is a typical, amazing lodge product... the pan is very well seasoned and the silicone handle is comfortable. Love it! Slightly bigger than I expected, but worth it. It\\'s got a nice weight to it, but even when I try to store this on the top shelf in my kitchen, it isn\\'t so heavy that I can\\'t lift it up there. This is my second cast iron skillet. I have the 12\" and now this 8 inch.  I never thought I would use cast iron with of all the cookware on the market today. But, I love how it cooks, high temps and easy clean up. If you spray pam, it becomes non-stick. Pancakes will brown evenly and  fish sautes nicely. I even bake in the oven in it. It\\'s just great, and I will never have to replace it. Good buy too!!! As most others I love this pan! I use it all the time. Heavier than what i thought. Definitely use pan scrappers on it. Worth every penny spent. What can I say? Just a great solid cast iron pan. Love that it\\'s made in the USA! Not saying other countries don\\'t make good products, however when I see made in the USA, I choose that first if it\\'s of good quality. Thanks Lodge Logic for helping to keep Americans employed for generations!! Lodge skillets have always been dependable. solid and gets the job done. comforting weight and seasons well.  I am not keen on the pre-seasoning they do - it doesn\\'t seem overly effective - especially if you cook sticky stuff like eggs and has a curious rough texture instead of a smooth to the touch finish you expect from well seasoned pans.However, these are way cheaper than used griswolds and wagners on ebay, and with a little care and seasoning becomes as good as them IMO, so definitely would recommend. TL;DR version - The skillet is awesome, it cooks everything from dutch babies to searing meat without any sticking or hot spots. No kitchen is complete without a cast iron skillet.------Now that\\'s out of the way, if you haven\\'t cooked with cast iron you\\'re missing out, and you\\'ve also got a lot to learn, so here\\'s a crash course to help figure out if this skillet is right for you.Advantages of cast iron:* cast iron has a high density, thus is retains heat extremely well* it\\'s great at distributing even heat* properly seasoned cast iron can perform with the best non-stick pans* they are built to last longer than you, many are passed down generation to generation* you could rearrange a home intruder\\'s face with a good swing of a cast iron panDisadvantages of cast iron:* unseasoned cast iron will rust quicker than you imagine* takes longer to heat up than your nonstick or steel* will probably crack if thermally shocked or dropped* they are heavier than any other type of cooking vesselA lot of the disadvantages of cast iron are easily addressable with a bit of common sense. First and foremost, cast iron has to be completely seasoned. This means the cooking surface, the bottom, the handle, everything. The good news is, this is pretty easy to do and the more you use the pan the better your seasoning gets.Seasoning your cookware:There are many discussions as to how to properly season cast iron. A recent post on lifehacker sums them up best. Basically what everyone agrees on is the vessel is covered in a layer of fat, and is put under high heat until the fat polymerizes. You let the pan cool, and repeat until you have multiple thin layers of polymerized fat. The discrepancies are what type of fat to use, the baking temp/time, and the best practices to maintain your seasoning.Traditionalists will argue that lard is best, because that\\'s the way it always has been done. I\\'ve seasoned with bacon fat, and I\\'m a big fan of it. It satisfies the inner animal in me and makes me feel I\\'m cooking in the manliest way possible without putting a whole animal into a fire - not that I\\'m insecure about such things. I\\'ve also seasoned with vegetable oil, and found that it produces almost identical performance that lard does. The food science crowd suggests using flax seed oil, because it polymerizes easiest. I haven\\'t had a chance to try seasoning with flax seed oil, but it\\'s what I plan on doing after my next move in a few months. Another point to bring up, is that cast iron used to be offered polished and unpolished. The Lodge skillet comes unpolished, meaning it has a textured surface. I think before I do the flax seed oil seasoning, I will likely use a dremel/sandpaper to smooth the cooking surface purely for aesthetic purposes to flaunt that I take care of my cookware. Polished cast iron does offer the benefit of more exposed internal pores, so the seasoning sticks better, but I\\'ve never had an issue seasoning so this point is moot.I\\'ve done both high heat and medium heat for seasoning, and I find that the hotter the oven the better the seasoning. If you fail to season above 350f, you will likely end up with a browned pan that is slightly sticky because the fat didn\\'t form a polymer, and will make you leave an unnecessary low star Amazon review and never know the benefits of cast iron. My suggestion is scrub the skillet with steel wool and soap until the water runs clear and you\\'re sure there\\'s no soap remaining on the cast iron. Dry the skillet completely, and cover with oil; make sure you get the handles, bottom, and top. Place a cookie sheet below the oven rack to catch any drips so you don\\'t burn the house down. Heat the oven to 400f to 500f and put the skillet in there and bake for an hour - not including the preheating time. Putting it in a cold oven may be unnecessary, however this is the thermal shock downfall I mentioned earlier. It\\'s better to get into the habit of avoiding massive temperature changes so you can pass the skillet down to your children\\'s children. After the hour, shut off the oven and allow the skillet to cook down. This initial seasoning layer isn\\'t quite ready for primetime, if you were to cook something with tomatoes, lemons, vinegar you could very well screw it all up because of the low PH reacting to the thin layer of fat polymer and possibly penetrating all the way to the cast iron. Too much science for me, so to be on the safe side if I\\'m going to be using the oven with temperatures in excess of 375f I make sure the cast iron gets another layer of fat and gets re-seasoned. Usually after about 3 or 4 trips to the oven, it could withstand just about anything.Now that you\\'re seasoned, how do you not screw this up? First and foremost, I use metal utensils on it because it inevitably makes it easier to clean if stuff isn\\'t stuck to it for very long. Providing you\\'re not trying drill for oil through the pan, the polymer should be hard enough to not flake off and ruin your day. Next, make sure you invest in a large thing of salt. I don\\'t think it\\'s anything chemical about salt that allows it to clean the pan, but it\\'s an edible scouring powder. I\\'ve read that because we generally don\\'t use dish soaps that contain lye, they should be gentle enough to use on cast iron. I cannot confirm or deny this, because I find just using salt and a bit of oil to make a paste works just as well. Get a paper towel and polish down the dried bits of food until it resembles how it started. It may not have the same shine, but you should be completely drying the skillet and applying a real thin coat of oil to it. There\\'s your shine. It\\'s important to continuously use the skillet to maintain the coat. This doesn\\'t mean every night, but treat yourself to a steak for dinner or pannekoeken for breakfast once a week - your skillet and taste buds will thank you. Love this size of cast iron skillet, it is perfect for one egg and sauteing onion and garlic.  I use it all the time. The price was great. I love this product. But just to warn you it is a lot heavier than non-cast iron skillets. Also, I was told my many people (including the teacher of a cooking class I am taking) that these skillets should not be put in the dishwasher. I\\'ve been looking for a really good cast iron pan and I finally found it! I used this to make my homemade turkey gravy and it cooked my turkey legs and wings perfectly! I love the silicone handle.It made transferring the pan from the stove to oven so easy and I didn\\'t have to worry about burning my hands. Just make sure to take the handle off before you leave it in the oven!! This is the first time i am using a cast iron pan. looks good - bit heavy. I was little apprehensive about the 15 inch size, after a few days of use i am convinced that this is the size i need.I started using right out of the box. Right now using it lightly so that it\\'ll get seasoned. Sauting vegetable is such a fun & healthy. The sauted veggies come very crispy. Made dosa (an Indian Dish) a few times, wow - yummmm. made some curries, haven\\'t started using for tomato based preparations, may be after a while.I am sure I\\'ll continue to use this BIGGGGG pan for life time & continue to add more cast iron tools in my kitchen towards healthy way of eating & living. This one has a rough interior surface that my older pans don\\'t have, so I don\\'t like it as well. It is just that small, but for those that want a quick small, single serving this is very effective. You can\\'t beat cast iron. I use it often. Cleans in a jiffy. I bought this because of the extra handle to assist lifting when heavy with contents. It\\'s a nice pan but not as thick as a vintage pan. It came pre-seasoned but I re-seasoned it anyway. I\\'ve used it to fry foods and there\\'s very little stickage. It was a very good price and I love that it came with the silicone handle that\\'s removable. The silicone handle comes off easily for cleaning. I gave it 4 stars because I had to return the first on. It came with two cracks but I believe it\\'s because it came with a smaller cast iron pan and it wasn\\'t packaged properly. Within a week, Amazon replaced the cracked pan without any hassle so I was very happy about that. If you can...ask friends, relatives or go to garage sales to find vintage cast iron pans because they\\'re the best. Fantastic cast iron pan.  The fact that it comes pre-seasoned is such a time saver.  Of course I still did my own seasoning after making a few meals, just because other cast iron users recommended so.  I love the versatility of cast iron over my non-stick cookware...you can go from stove top into oven.  I\\'ll be acquiring more lodge cast iron! Have been using for 1 week,Spray with GV  non stick cooking oil  before and after each use, wipe with paper towel, Eggs slide out like a non stick coated pan. It does have a iron taste that  will fade with use.This skillet is better than some of the cheaper cast on the market ,It has smooth clean edges,  Always use cast , they can\\'t be beat. I just made me a hell of a steak in this last night.  Put the pan in your oven, heat to 450 for at least 20 minutes.  Put room temperature rib-eye steaks in the pan, put back in the oven for 3-4 minutes.  Flip steaks, put back in oven for 3 minutes or until desired doneness.  Salt and pepper, let rest for a couple of minutes.  Enjoy. Lodge Logic L10SK3 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet, always loved cast iron and this Skillet is no different. One of the nicest I have ever bought. Good coating and cooks great! Lodge is the ONLY cast iron skillet you should ever consider. I\\'ve used them my whole life, as did my Mother, Grandmothers and everyone else in our whole family. They\\'re amazing tools and give fantastic results with a minimum of care and bother. I have been a big fan of cast iron for awhile now, and have had this Lodge Logic pan for about 4 years. I have used pans from several different cast iron manufacturers, but after watching a video on their manufacturing process, I favor Lodge Logic over the others. However, there are two main problems I have with this pan.1. Handle is too short.  The handle on my 8\" cast iron pan is larger than this one.  This is a big pan, and the handle needs to be 1\" longer, and .5\" wider to be able to easily maneuver this very heavy pan, especially when you consider that people will be wearing oven mitts, which leaves even less room. If you\\'re not going to move the pan around much, it\\'s not a big deal, but people who don\\'t have strong forearms will probably have a problem with this.  It is just way too short and thin for a pan of this size. As you can see, there is a hook on the opposite side of it for hanging the pan, however if you have something heavy in it, it\\'s best to hold the pan from both ends.2.  The pre-seasoning is worthless.  As soon as I got the pan, I followed the instructions, which only consisted of rinsing in hot water.  Then I put it on a burner and set it to medium high to preheat. I have been using cast iron pans for a long time.  I have three other cast iron pans that are beautifully seasoned, and I have self-seasoned cast iron at least 20 times.  I know how to care for these pans and how to use them.  Within 5 minutes of putting this pan on my stove, the middle of the pan started to turn grey, meaning that the seasoning was burning off.  Within 15 minutes on medium high with nothing in the pan, the seasoning was completely burned off and I was left with a grey pan.  I then had to take a drill and sanding pad and remove all of the manufacturer\\'s seasoning, wash it completely with soap, then re-season the entire pan (properly).  Once I did that, it was fine. I would suggest that anyone who gets this, season it first a few times before cooking with high heat. You can do this by coating it with vegetable oil and putting it in the over for a couple hours, or just cook some bacon and sausage in it a few times and it should be fine.Aside from the handle problem and this, it is a great pan and I\\'m sure I will have it for years to come, but don\\'t trust the manufacturer\\'s seasoning and do it yourself.Some of the accessories I use with mine are:Lodge Set of 2 Durable Polycarbonate Pan Scrapers,Red and Black- These things are great. I struggled for years with trying to clean the pan without soap and without scrubbing off the seasoning patina.  These little scrapers allow you to get rid of stuck on food.  You can then put the pan on low or medium, drop some kosher salt into it, and put a folded up paper towel over the salt mound and use it as an abrasive to scrub off any other food and clean it. When the paper towel is no longer dark black, you\\'ll know you\\'re done.  Wipe it out once and coat with a thin layer of vegetable oil while the pan is warm.  Then lay a paper towel inside it and it is ready until next use.Lodge Max Temp Handle Mitt, Black- A handle mitt is great for leaving on the handle, which will get very hot.  This way you don\\'t have to worry about forgetting to pick up the pan with a towel or oven mitt and accidentally burning your hand.Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Rectangular Cast-Iron Grill Press- Use this for flattening out your bacon or pressing down on a grill cheese sandwich. Ok, if you want a cast iron MONSTER- the 15 inch skillet is for you.  If you can lift it, that is.  This is HEAVY.  I should weigh it, because it has to weigh at least 25lbs.  It is huge as well- and doesn\\'t fit very well on my standard stove burners.... but gosh it is cool looking and can hold a LOT of food!  All I can say is know what you are getting into and pay attention because this really is a MONSTER!  If it is your first cast iron skillet go with a smaller size. Great size for a single person to whip up an omelette or hash browns or anything else I would do with a frying pan.  I should have taken off a star for the preseasoning, but after scrubbing and reseasoning the old-fashioned way, it works like a charm! I love my cast iron pans!  I bought 3 different Lodge cast iron pans and they seem to be very high quality. The pre-seasoning works great and they are easy to clean with just warm water.They are easy to work with but do require adjusting your cooking method compared to steep or aluminum pans. - I tend to warm the skillet for a few 5mins on med-low heat (while empty) and turn the heat off 5mins before the end of cooking time.  (The cast iron hold its heat long enough to continue to cook for 5-10mins).The only issue I have with these pans is when adding minced garlic to a dish being fried.  The garlic tends to stick and damages the patina if not removed immediately after cooking.I messed up the finish on one pan (by scrubbing the patina off), but followed the instructions on Lodge\\'s website to re-season and it worked perfect.I definitely recommend these pans. Can cook 2 things at once in this pan.  Very roomy can cook entire breakfast!Although I do like to caution to everyone that cast iron is heavy! We have aLodge Logic LPGI3 Pro Grid Cast Iron Grill/GriddleandLodge Logic L10SK3 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skilletthat we love, the latter of which resides permantly on our stove. However, the 12\" skillet is too small for two ribeye steaks or a big family-size chicken curry.My first impression of the 15-inch skillet it how massive it is. Also quite heavy....Cast iron is great for moving things from the stove to the oven, such as with roasting vegetables. We don\\'t have a lid that fits this pan though, so can\\'t really cover and simmer.We\\'ve been using it for six months now, and it\\'s taken some abuse. We often don\\'t wash it right away, and we cook tomato-based foods and curries and such in it, and the seasoning is holding up well. However, without even washing it from last nights burgers, I fried eggs in it this morning easy-over, without breaking yolks (a little bacon grease helps). I have always been a fan of iron skillets.  My family is happy with the nice results I get when using this skillet.  I have seen these at a much higher price in some stores. pan is as described.  solid cast iron.  a bit bulky and gets real hot.  big props to amazon for replacing a missing order/shipment, excellent customer service. I bought this as a quick and inexpensive way to cook up stir fry. The skillet cost me $15 through the Amazon Warehouse, so it seemed like Lodge and Amazon were practically begging me to buy it.The skillet works extremely well for its intended purpose. It does take a little getting used to, though, in that washing it with detergent would take off the preseasoning. I\\'m not overly concerned about this--reseasoning a skillet requires no more than a coating of Crisco in an oven at 350 for an hour. But I don\\'t want to be doing it overly much. In the end, I\\'ve found that scrubbing out the pan with plain hot water and a synthetic pad or brush will do the trick.Did I mention that this skillet is HEAVY? I\\'m 190 and in relatively good shape, and the skillet can still be a bear to handle. Using two hands (there\\'s a handle on both ends) is safest. Try one hand only if you\\'re trying to show off. The elderly or less strong will have difficulty with this pan. My girlfriend, a 55 yo RN, can\\'t handle it.But if you don\\'t mind the heft and have the storage space, it\\'s a great pan to have around. You\\'ll never have to fry anything in batches again. You had better take out a ruler and peruse just how large this pan is before purchasing. The pre-seasoning is excellent. Only problem I see is that the interior has a roughness. It\\'s definitely stick resistant but the surface roughness makes cleaning with paper towels difficult because the pan picks up fibers from the towel. Do NOT let being a \"cast iron snob\" deter you from buying a $20 pre-seasoned skillet.When I received it, I put it next to an 80-year-old perfectly-seasoned griddle and they looked almost identical.I\\'ve been making grilled cheese sandwiches left and right since it arrived and even the \"stuck-on\" cheese wipes right up with a damp paper towel.If there\\'s a similar dutch oven, I\\'m buying it STAT! You won\\'t be disappointed. I *love* my cast iron skillet and the 12-inch model has been a dream in so many ways.But ladies, you need to realize how heavy this big boy really is.For years, I\\'ve needed to cook for large groups.  Turns out that I was stronger when I was younger.  Now that it\\'s just my husband and me, I don\\'t need such a large cooking pot and I can\\'t handle it anyway.You can forget picking it up with one hand and pouring out gravy while scraping with the other.  It\\'s just too dang heavy.  As I usually make gravy with almost every dinner, this is a huge problem for me.  The 12-inch skillet is 8 pounds.  That is a LOT of hot pan for one hand to tip and control.  Add the weight of the food, and it\\'s not reasonable for the average middle-age woman to handle this pan.Just remember - NO SOAP.  I clean my pan by boiling water in it while scraping the bottom, then dumping out the water and scrubbing my pan with a little salt.  I then reheat my pan to dry it then lightly re-oil it.  It\\'s easier than it sounds and ends up becoming a natural part of cleaning the kitchen after a meal.******************************I just knocked it down another star because I bought a Camp Chef and now I know the difference.I thought that the Lodge pre-season was what we had to deal with in life.  I didn\\'t know it could be so much better.I\\'m sticking with Camp Chef from now on. This is the third Lodge skillet I\\'ve owned and I use it almost every day. I purchased the 10.25\" one.So long as you handle it properly, heat it slowly and add a bit of oil before the food, your food will never stick.I was admittedly skeptical about a preseasoned pan, I\\'d heard so many bad things. Don\\'t be. This pan has been great. I heated it to 500 degrees in my oven, coated it with veggie oil, placed it back into the oven and let it cool. This added my own layer of seasoning. I\\'ve never noticed black flakes in my food or any other detriments of a preseasoned pan. I\\'ll buy many more preseasoned Lodge items in the future. I had forgotten how much I loved cooking with a cast iron skillet.  If you can\\'t find a Griswold then this is the next best thing.  I have been seasoning this along the way and it is perfect for your braising and high temperature frying. Will continue to enjoy for years and pass along. I\\'m a newbie skillet user but my significant other said he made the best egg sandwich EVER in this thing! So far had it about a week and it\\'s been holding up well! The first time I used the pan the chicken dish did not stick. I washed the pan with only water and a sponge dried completely and put a little cooking oil on and put it away. Next day the second time I used the pan I was frying potatoes and they stuck super bad! Ruined the potatoes most of them were stuck to the pan. This is my first cast iron pan and I am very disappointed! Do not understand why other reviews say the pan is non stick. Very unhappy!Update: I have now been using my pan everyday and it is working perfect. I am so glad I kept trying and followed others advice and now this is my favorite pan! I give it 5 stars and I plan to buy a Dutch oven next. Now nothing sticks and I just wipe clean with paper towels and water and finish with a light coat of oil. Perfect!!!! Very happy now. This is the first cast iron skillet I have owned. I had some issues at first adjusting to cast iron but now that I\\'ve used it a bit and got used to it, I love it! Now come on everybody!  This is a MINIATURE skillet, as they advertise, so to say it is small (like that\\'s a bad thing) doesn\\'t make much sense.  I\\'m glad to see that 2 out of 3 people here enjoy it for what it is.  I didn\\'t purchase it to cook meals in because I was well aware of its size going in.  I love it just because...I give it five stars for two reasons - 1) It is cute as a bug; and 2) It\\'s made by Lodge, so it is clearly great quality cast iron.Admittedly I have not actually \\'used\\' it for anything, but then I had no aspirations of it serving any practical purpose.  I like the melting butter idea that another reviewer mentioned.  Thank You for that.  I do have the little Lodge melting pot, but sometimes even that is bigger than what I need.  This cute little skillet would be perfect for that also.Did I mention that it is cute? :) I am so pleased with this skillet! Since it arrived, it has been very used:-)  I have made Iron Skillet Yeast Bread in it and I have already made two big skillets of Fried Green Tomatoes.  It was already pre-treated when it arrived.  Easy clean up and I lightly coat with olive oil before I put it away.  Can\\'t wait to make a pineapple upside down cake and many more recipes I have on my Iron Skillet pin board. I called my daughter and told her to be sure and always buy a Lodge brand when she buys a iron skillet:-)  I hope to buy more and replace my pots and pans with iron.  Great cooked food and healthy in iron and can always cook outside on a open fire in an emergency or camping.  I am sold!  I can\\'t wait to be able to buy the pot to make artisan bread in. Love It and thank you! Inexpensive, great quality, cooks evenly, works as advertized. Really, the best money spent in the kitchen thus far. Buy one for yourself and you won\\'t be disappointed. This pan is exceptional.. I only buy LODGE when it comes to cast iron. They season them fairly well and YES food will stick for a little while when you first use it (depending on the food) but, after a while, that all stops as you use it more and more and the food begins to become tastier and tastier due to natural seasoning...Word to the Wise... DO NOT USE SOAP EVER ON A CAST IRON. Just hot water and a brush. Then dry and put a dollop of olive oil or the like on it and spread it around the pan so it prevents rust. (this is best done when the pan is still hot) Great size for bigger jobs.  I can easily sear two large steaks or several chicken breasts in this skillet at the same time.  It\\'s very heavy and thus difficult to pick up and toss ingredients around, but that\\'s not really the purpose of a skillet this size anyway.  Get this for the big jobs and a smaller one as well.  You won\\'t regret it. Very nice!  Lodge products are great.  Can\\'t think of buying something else when it comes to cast iron products.  Sweet! It is very small but fits one egg perfectly.  Sometimes the induction cooktop will not recognise the skillet which is very annoying.  Also even after applying oil to the pan the egg still tends to stick. Good size, no problems.  Lodge is the best.  Of any other skillets I have purchased, I would stick with Lodge.  Good size pan. I ordered two of these 6.5 inch skillets for my adult son to cook personal dishes with. He loves them. They are exactly like my Lodge 10\" seasoned skillet and I will order more mini skillets for myself. I went with the 6.5\" size based on the comments that said the 5\" wasn\\'t really 5\" but smaller. I must say the 6.5\" is perfect for a good-sized single serve. Thanks folks! ;-) first time using a skillet this heavy.  easy to use , looked at many videos to learn how to season the pan.  And so far its been very useful.  i enjoy using this pan.  very good product Very happy with the pan. Its been 4 months I bought this and its non-stick from the first use. I use this for Indian pancakes and rotis, they come out great. They don\\'t stick and the taste is great.Two minor problems: One, its heavy, and second, the handle gets very hot. I wish they come with a wodden handle. But, its a minor problem. I always leave a cheap (99c from Ikea) oven mit on the handle.Amazon.com is the only place (that my friends & I know of) that sells these wonderful cast iron skillets for price this low. I can\\'t believe Amazon ships this free considering the weight of this pan. Can\\'t beat the value! MADE IN THE USA!!!!!  There are so may reasons to love this pan.  Every time I use it I feel good about providing  jobs in the USA and the quality is excellent.  It\\'s the perfect size for a grilled cheese, 2-4 scrambled eggs, and many other small cooking tasks.  It heats up quickly and evenly.  Clean up was super easy--hot water and a little elbow grease.  The first thing I made with this pan was scrambled eggs--let the pan heat up, add some butter, then add the eggs.  People who struggle with really messy pans don\\'t let them heat up first.  They secret is to let the pan get warm then add the cooking fat.  I\\'m looking forward to passing these down to my children some day. I love this pan.  This is a good size to fry 3 or 4 eggs.  It\\'s the perfect size if you have to cook something that\\'s not too large or too small. I use it several times a week. This is my go-to skillet for a wide range of cooking I do these days, and it excels at pan-frying and searing meat.Clean-up is surprisingly easy, if quite a bit different than the non-stick cookware I (used to) use; usually I deglaze the pan with about a cup or two of water immediately after cooking, then, once the skillet has cooled, I pour out the water, scrape off any loose debris with a spatula, dry it with paper towels, then pour a couple tablespoons of kosher salt and peanut oil into the pan, scrubbing it with more paper towels and then clean off the salt. I just used this pan for the first time.  It is a wonderful addition to my cooking utensils.  It is a large fry pan and for that fact alone I love it.  I do agree with most of the reviews on the cast iron products that the seasoning on these pre seasoned pieces could be better.  HOWEVER, let it be known seasoning is so simple.  Also just using the pan frequently makes it improve with age.  I have been familiar with cast iron pans since I was a child.  They are heavy  pieces but so worth the lift. :) Cleaning the residual food off, as you never use soap, is so simple.  Use a plastic card, for instance an old credit card, to scrape the pan.  However I do not necessarily say to use a credit card as I do not believe in letting them lay around.  I just wanted to get the idea of what type of card across to you.  Nothing beats cast iron cooking.  I am trying to replace all my pans and pots with cast iron.  Obviously very satisfied.  Hope you find this helpful. It goes without saying. I just love all my Lodge products and this 8 inch skillet is no different. This is my personal skillet now. Cooking and cleaning is no hassle. Highly recommend it for purchase. Thank you. My friend was complaining constantly about some of his Teflon skillets and how soon they were trashed - even the more expensive ones.  I recommended seasoned cast iron and he tried this skillet.  Need I say, he\\'s sold on cast iron!  These come pre-seasoned so those who are intimidated by seasoning cast iron can relax - this skillet really is well seasoned & is truly &#34;no stick.&#34; When my husband destroyed our Calphalon omelet pan by overheating it (again), I decided it was time for cast iron. It took me a long time to purchase this skillet because I couldn\\'t decide between a pre-seasoned skillet or a new one that required seasoning. After doing some research and finding multiple recommendations for this brand (including one from my favorite food blogger), I decided to give it the pre-seasoned one a try. It\\'s great! Don\\'t let the reputation of cast iron scare you off - it\\'s easy to cook with once you get the hang of it. And it\\'s easy to clean too. Just scrape it out while it\\'s still hot, dry it off and cover with a light coating of oil. Easy to use, easy to care for - a great addition to any kitchen! Prior to purchasing this skillet, I hadn\\'t  used a cast iron skillet since the early 80s. I stopped using them when all the &#34;new and improved&#34; Teflon and stainless steel skillets took over the market. Well, after purchasing several sets of pots and pans over the past 25 years + I decided to go back to cast iron. It cooks better and can be used outside on a campfire, inside in the oven or on a stove top. Very versatile indeed. Easier to take care of since it doesn\\'t matter if it gets scratched or not. Now I\\'m going to purchase another cast iron skillet and a dutch oven and call it a day.The old-fashioned way is the best way in my opinion when it comes to cooking and baking. If you are smart & don\\'t use soap on this pan, it become as non-stick as any Teflon pan. I use a stiff brush & some warm water, usually works great, especially if you do it right after taking the food out of the pan. If there is food stuck on the bottom of the pan that does not easily come out using the stiff brush & warm water, then just put some water in the pan, sit it back on the stove until the water starts to simmer, then scrub the pan right away- that has worked for me every time. If you use soap on this pan then you will ruin the non-stick effect & will have to start from scratch by oiling down the pan, sticking it in a hot oven for a bit- the directions that come with it will tell you exactly how long to \"season it\" again if you need to.But I absolutely love this pan! I can cook an omelet in it now & it will slide right out of the pan when I\\'m done. Following others advice, I just cooked bacon for the first time and I was good to go. Been using it mainly for cooking egg souffles actually to cook what we feel in love with in Istanbul: [...]good size for a single hearty meal. The quality you\\'d expect from Lodge, for an extremely reasonable price. This pan is just large enough to make a single small meal, and the pan also be a serving dish. If you\\'re lazy, like me, it\\'s nice to have only one dish to clean up after a meal. ...just using a bigger cast iron skillet and cooking the eggs on one side of the pan with the heat concentrated under it.  I prefer to cook over-easy eggs with this size skillet, one at a time, but I would recommend just using your larger cast iron skillet for the same task, at no extra charge.It does it\\'s job perfectly fine, but I wouldn\\'t bother spending more money than you have to. I found the skillet to be pretty well-seasoned.  It is sturdy and heats evenly.  I am usually cooking for one, sometimes two, and it is a good size for that- plenty of space to cook the food but not huge. I watched a video on how they make these in the USA... well made, and they distribute heat very evenly. I\\'ve used this to fry taco shells and chicken. Both came out great! I prefer to use it for anything that needs to go from the stove top to the oven.It\\'s a great quality, super heavy + great price. I bought this because I thought I was gonna make some cornbread... It\\'s still under my stove unused.  It\\'s really heavy (which I knew) so I\\'m to lazy to get it out and just cook with my lighter aluminum stuff.  I sort of wish I didn\\'t buy it now but I don\\'t mind it being in the drawer. One of my go-to fry pans in my kitchen!  I love Lodge cast iron pans and own many.  I own two of this size which really come in handy on fried potatoes, bacon and egg weekends.  I use a larger 13 1/2&#34; to do the bacon.  I cook so many things in these smaller cast iron pans I probably could fill the page but I won\\'t bore people.  Just figure anything you can cook in a regular stainless steel pan (which I own many of) will cook better in a well seasoned, loved and used Lodge cast iron pan!  Great pans, if properly cared for, will live on long after you and I are gone! We use this particular pan on a daily basis and have done so for years. As we eat real breakfasts (not sugary processed crap like cereal or pastries) most of the time, this pan is essentially a breakfast pan.  We keep the bacon grease from cooking bacon in it for a week or so at a time, which obviously keeps it well-seasoned and lets us cook fried eggs in it easy as pie.  If you eat real food for breakfast I would definitely recommend having a Lodge cast iron pan dedicated to just this task.  If you don\\'t have a lid then tuck this pan into the oven when not in use, to keep anything from getting into the bacon grease.I\\'m sure I\\'ll just echo everyone else when I see Lodge cast iron is excellent quality and the price is outstanding for what you\\'re getting (a pan that will last forever, instead of a non-stick pan that is bad for your health and will only last a couple of years).  This pan is HEAVY so be prepared for that. This small skillet is great! I use it for baking cornbread, braising meat, blackened fish, etc...It\\'s size is perfect for one or two people. Use it a while to build a non-stick surface before cooking eggs on it. I\\'ve had it for over a year, using it about once or twice a week. Overall, it is not bad. It just depends on what you cook and how you manage to cook it. Things I learned are1. It heats up slowly, and maintain temperature very steadily. It can keep your food warm for quite a while before you serve, especially pancake, or toasted bread2. It is pre-seasoned. I did not bother to season it again. It is not completely nonstick for certain food. for example, I can\\'t use it to pan fry Tofu (without breading), Tofu is very soft and porous, this pan is porous too. These 2 just get stick with each other.3 It works really well to pan fry anything that is not porous. For example, pancake, dumpling,...... When I use it to make golden pan fry dumplings, I just put in dumplings at very low temperature, it may look like it is sticky at the beginning, just be patient and the dumpling will come off easily when it is ready (golden at the bottom)4. I have to use lots of cooking oil, some of which I guess fills the porous bottom. Maybe if you use it more often than I do, you could end up with a more smooth natural seasoning. Lodge cast-iron skillets are very good quality, which you want when you\\'re considering buying cast iron.I knew this would be a good skillet, and when I saw the great price, I ordered one for my father-in-law, who lives and cooks alone.  He loves it and says he uses it daily. This was purchased for 8.00 dollars, hard to beat the price, durability is good and works as described. How do you tell Calphalon to go to hell? On Amazon I guess. I am getting tired of getting bent over by Calphalon and their high priced well marketed cookware. Everything I have of theirs the coating is flaking, peeling, or worn off. Everyone thinks I am putting too much black pepper in my mashed potatoes when I don\\'t put a single damn pinch of pepper in my mashed potatoes. I use a god damn silicone coated masher, the pot\\'s never see anything abrasive and yet I have parmesan teflon mashed potatoes every time. Its gross, and probably not good for me either. At least with this cast iron skillet from lodge if I get a chunk of it in my food it\\'s only iron and your body needs that anyway. Why the hell I bought the 15&#34; makes no sense. It\\'s f-ing huge. I used to eat 3 eggs for breakfast, now I guess I should eat a dozen so I don\\'t waste any pan area. I would say it makes breakfast for 3 comfortably or for one fat son of a b Another reviewer mentioned roasted potatoes.  I agree, this is the perfect little skillet for a single serving size of potatoes.  Try this recipe for a late night snack:1 baking potato2 or 3 unpeeled garlic cloves, (optional)1 pat of butterShredded cheddar cheeseOlive oilSalt & pepper to tasteWash potato and cut in half lengthwise.  Cut the pat of butter in half and place in skillet. Put a potato half, cut side down, on top of each piece.  Lightly coat the garlic cloves with olive oil.  Place cloves in skillet.  Place skillet in oven and bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes or until tender.  The cut portion of the potato will brown and crisp.  Remove potato halves and garlic from skillet.  Carefully remove garlic skin. Make a slit in the cut portion of the potato halves.  Add garlic if using and season to taste with additional butter, salt and pepper.  Top with cheddar cheese.I make this in my 8 inch cast iron skillet a lot. It\\'s the perfect size for single serving meals and snacks.  It also makes the best hash browns and since it\\'s not that heavy and already preseasoned, you can flip the hash browns like the pro\\'s!The 8\" and 6\" cast iron skillets are also great for tapas. Set them on trivets and serve right at the table. I am a complete convert to cast-iron cooking. At first I was somewhat concerned about the whole concept of \"seasoning\" a pan. It\\'s just seems so much easier to rely on non-stick cookware.FEAR NOT! Seasoning a cast-iron pan is very easy (follow the included instructions or do a Google search) and once you get used to the process of keeping it seasoned, which is simple, and cleaning it, which is very simple, you will never go back to non-stick.I now own a 12\", a 10\" and an 8\" Lodge skillet. I also own a 5qt Lodge Dutch Oven. I have a 10\" lid which fits both the Dutch Oven (which it came with) and the 10\" skillet. I have disposed of every other skillet I own. I have been very happy with Lodge products and will continue to add them to my cooking arsenal as I need them.The first time you remove something from the stove top and place it directly into the oven in the same pan, you will be hooked. Especially when you can clean the properly seasoned pan with just a few wipes of a wet cloth no matter what you\\'ve cooked in it.Here is a tip for making cleaning a cast-iron skillet easier with no scrubbing. Just as you would use a liquid to reduce a sauce in a recipe (which also serves to get all the little flavorful bits sticking to the pan off); after you are finished cooking, dump a cup or two of water into the hot pan and let it boil for a few minutes. Dump this out and run a little fresh water into the pan and you should be able to easily wipe it clean with a damp cloth. Never use soap. You don\\'t need it. I haven\\'t used a nonstick pan since I purchased this and I don\\'t know if I will again. The best food I have ever cooked came out of this pan, from a well seared steak to juicy bacon cheeseburgers. Love that I can use the pan on stove top and in the oven.P.S. If you want the perfect steak I recommend Alton Brown\\'s method in the first Good Eats episode: [...] I read about the seasoned pans on some food blog and, considering the price, I decided to go for it. I seasoned it according to instructions I found online (everyone says to disregard &#34;seasoned&#34; description of this product), essentially you just put some coconut oil in it, just to moisten the bottom and the sides and put it in the very hot oven for an hour or two. And the most important part: never wash it with soap. At first I only cooked greasy things in it, to give it that extra seasoning, things like bacon, fried chicken, etc. Now I can use it for eggs, greens, crepes, etc without any trouble. I wash it immediately after use and while it\\'s still hot. I just put it under hot running water, scrub whatever food is still in the pan with the brush and DONE! This pan is always clean and ready for anything! I\\'ve never had a pan before that I\\'ve been able to use on the stovetop and then just shove right into the oven - and it has really opened up a whole new area of cooking for me!  The steaks that I\\'ve been able to make now are better than anything I\\'ve ever made before.  My fiancee and I have been looking for new recipes to try out in this new pan, which is a lot of fun.  It\\'s worth noting that this thing is a BEAST though, it is very heavy and tough to move, and takes up basically an entire rack in the oven.  This isn\\'t a problem, but just worth noting.  I\\'ve been very happy with this pan and would definitely recommend it! I have had this skillet for a long time. After having used this for so long, I have finally learned how to use it better.There are several different versions of how you season a cast iron skillet. I did not use a \"best practice\" before. And I wondered why food would stick to the skillet. . . I have checked out suggestions on the Internet and have come to know how to season this better. More recently, I have not had those same problems.I had moved away from cast iron skillets to nonstick skillets. My recent return to my 12 inch cast iron skillet has convinced me to use this as opposed to my nonsticks. I even purchased a cast iron Dutch Oven recently as a result of recent successes with this tool.So, a satisfied user. . . . Love it. I read so many complaints by those that taken the time to understand how to use and care for cast iron cookware. I Don\\'t know that much but I heard that after cooking you use water to boil it clean then wash it, then to dry it you fry it dry. draining and letting air dry, or towel dry isn\\'t enough and could cause it to rust. That said, thousands of 5 star reviews say Lodge cast iron is the best of the best. and I agree. and food just cooks better and evenly in cast iron. another advantage is they don\\'t have the toxic teflon surface. back to nature with the lodge pans. I found the 12 inch variety to excessive for everyday use for me. This 10.25 hits the sweet spot for me. I\\'m getting several 10.25 items so they all can share the same $16.00 lid. Most importantly, it fits 2 or 3  burgers comfortably. and the handle does not get to hot frying them. additionally the second handle helps some situations with the weight. My luck with cookware of this make has been uneven.  That includes the heating properties, also uneven.  With each successive use, this pan gets better and better.  I do clean the pan immediately after each use, which prevents buildup on the surface that impairs even heating.  Beats the comparable make griddle, both used on a gas stove. Just today, fried eggs did not stick, and hash browns browned evenly and flipped easily. Never loved cast iron in the past, but this is great. Requires minimal upkeep (use a brush to clean it, pour a little oil into it and wipe it around with a paper towel, store it in the stove where it\\'s a little warm). Heats evenly, even on an old coil electric stove, and is virtually nonstick. This is the only frying pan I use anymore, for everything from pancakes to browning meats. No problem with acid reactions. It\\'s just a matter of taking care of it, cleaning it soon after you use and and never, ever, letting it sit in water. Actually this is my wife\\'s review... &#34;Great&#34;  she really likes it and it goes with the set of others I got for her.  Really good quality. The skillet is sturdy and seems a little deeper than the photo, and the 8&#34; size is very versatile. It\\'s easy to clean and food does not get baked on to the surface. This is a great piece.  I am fairly new to cast iron, but this was my latest buy and I was not disappointed!  You can fit a lot in it, it has two handles for ease in handling.  The two pouring lips are very convienient.I suggest investing in the little hot pads that Lodge makes for the handles - they are also invaluable. I grew up with cast iron skillets but hadn\\'t used one in years.  It\\'s finding its way into my cooking routine more and more often.  This is a good product that will get lots of use. This Lodge pan was purchased for my brother, but I have the same pan, it\\'s just a lot older.  (But then, so am I...)  I love cast iron for cooking, but you need to know how to clean them properly in order for them to remain seasoned so that they don\\'t rust, and food doesn\\'t stick.  Cast iron is heavy - so the addition of the small handle on a big pan makes it much easier to handle safely.  These go from range to oven with no problem - you can sear a piece of meat on the stove, then finish it in the oven, without having to transfer the meat to another pan. There are some recipes that just taste better when you use these old iron pans.  I bought several in varying sizes and I love them.  I also have my stainless steel which I love as well.  The flavor of food made in these iron pans is just to die for.  Clean up is a little more challenging, but not as bad as one might think.  Great for camping. I have had a 12\" skillet for years and finally decided to purchase the 15\" skillet and dutch ovens.Very pleased. Great quality.Yes the pieces are heavy, but truly the best for frying, grilling, and roasting.I don\\'t like to use non stick pans anymore, these items give you the ease of non stick clean up (let the pan cool, rinse in warm water, wipe clean, rub a little oil and your done) and the taste and control for good cooking.I have a full assortment of high quality All Clad, which is good for somethings, but the Lodge items are my favorite cookware. had a few cast iron pans - Lodge is the way to go and preseasoned makes your life a lot easier - I like this one - can\\'t say i will use it for everything - but it is the way to sear and cook a steak if you want it brown on outside and rare on inside - i like this one I find that when I want to pan fry chicken this is the best skillet to use.So far I have not had any issues, but if I do, I will season again.Glad I purchased it. ...with cast iron! This baby is so versatile in the kitchen! I fry in it and it keeps the oil at an even temp. I bake savory and sweet things in i. I use it to make one pot dinners. I mean, this is the hero of my kitchen! I love it so much that I purchased a 2 burner griddle/grill. We love that as well. Next on the wish list is an enamel Dutch oven. I never used a iron skillet before, and I knew that they require some special care, so I was very nervous about buying one, but so far we\\'ve been managing great. And a lot of the food we like DOES taste better prepared this way - much crispier. I really enjoy this skillet, I am getting ready to throw all my old tefflon expensive skillets since they only lasted 2 years!  I will replace them all with Lodge Logic cast iron skillets of all different sizes!! There are a lot of things that just taste better on a cast iron skillet.  Omelets are one of them.  Not to mention Hamburgers and Hot Dogs.  Just about anything you can do on the grill you can do on this skillet.  Just get a scrub brush and use hot water only when cleaning.  Also make sure it is pre-heated before you start cooking (about 10 minutes on medium-low heat). High quality skillet.  I was pleased with the rubber handle.  It is easy to get off and put back on. I use this skillet daily. It\\'s wonderful for steaks, burgers, everything you can think of! I wish all of my cooking supplies were as awesome as this one, but it is really annoying that can\\'t dishwash it. I would buy 5 more of these if I could right now, but I will eventually! I bought this on a Whim, I think it was on Special for less than $8.00You can\\'t beat Cast Iron, Once it\\'s seasoned properly, even though these are Pre-Seasoned, They just seem to cook better if you season them with oil for a 1/2 hour on Low heat.This Pan works Great for Frying 1 - 2 Eggs or Saut&eacute;ing onions, peppers etc..or even frying a single Hamburger. I definitely end up using it more than I thought. Glad I bought it. I have a cast iron Wok that I purchased from the WokShop in San Francisco (check out their web site), to me it is the only kind of wok to purchase as it gives that really authentic \"oriental\" flavor to whatever you cook in it (preheating a dry Wok is essential before adding oil).  I just love it!  I find this is also true for for the cast iron skillet. It just gives great flavor to the food not to mention the addition of beneficial iron. The Lodge skillet doesn\\'t require seasoning which is a plus.  The cast iron skillet is significantly more heavy (7 lb.) than my Wok however.  I would still recommend this skillet just be prepared for an upper body workout when using and washing it, but hey we can all use more exercise can\\'t we!  It wouldn\\'t work however for someone who was elderly or has arthritis or a disability that made lifting heavy objects difficult. This is great--very heavy and sturdy.  Pre-seasoned very well.  America\\'s Test Kitchen rates this the best.  The only downside is the handle is a little short for the weight of the pan.  they put a second handle on it across from it and that is almost essential to use when moving it around.  I do not see this as too big of a deal but would have preferred a longer handle.  I went with the shorter handle, however, because America\\'s Test Kitchen rated this particular one so high. My MIL got my husband and I a 10.25 in and a 15 inch for Christmas, and it\\'s been a god send. The way my husband cooks has destroyed a few of the non-stick teflon pans I bought that are as expensive, if not more expensive than these Lodge Logic cast iron skillets. Each of the pans/skillets I buy will last no more than a 5 months before he destroys them. I finally asked for some cast iron skillets to replace them. They\\'ve been great! They are easy to clean, he only managed to get food stuck on the skillet once, and even then it was much easier to remove the caked on food than it was on the teflon skillets I bought. When I use the skillets food never sticks on them, so I am not sure what secret technique my husband\\'s using to get food to stick.After using the pans, some salt (I use table salt) and oil with a sponge will clean off the surface of the skillet. Then, just rinse with hot water (remember to wear gloves), dry it off with a towel, coat with a layer of oil, and leave it on the side for next time.I liked these skillets so much I just bought a griddle/grill combo from them too. So far so good. I use it only once a week or so but nothing sticks to it. I cook fish and steaks on it. I knew LODGE castiron pans had a strong and reliable reputation. Therefore, this is why I purchased this brand and also the fact being PRE SEASONED was another reason.The next item in line I had to consider was the size.  So in doing my research most recipes called for this size.Since receiving the skillet it has a workout and very pleased with it.  Plus, not only with the product but the seller.So if your in the market to purchase and possibly a little skeptical............Go For It!!!!!!!The price is great. This is a quality skillet that can withstand a lot.  I think it is perfect for a first cast iron piece.  It is, however, very heavy. I am 5\\'2 and I had to learn to lift it without hurting my wrist/arm. Nice size and quality. After reading other reviews, I seasoned the skillet several more times in the oven at 500 degrees for an hour at a time to obtain the dark black surface coating they were describing. I\\'ve used the skillet several times and I\\'m very happy with the results and cleanup has been surprisingly easy. I bought this for my daughter who has wanted a cast iron skillet for a long time.  It is a nice size and pre-seasoned is a huge plus.  She loves it and I would recommend it. people still wonder why I continue to use cast iron, I can only say that you NEVER will replace it if you care for it right.... I\\'m very happy with this having switched from a much lighter teflon pan which was leaving pieces of teflon in my food. This skillet heats up quickly and has evenly distributed heat. It is however ver HEAVY and makes for your needing arm strength if you need to lit it to pour or remove food from it. Clans right up each time and I am thrilled with it! I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She said nothing sticks from the first time she used it because it is pre-seasoned. I love cooking with cast iron skillets and have several.  I\\'m considering buying myself one of these because I don\\'t have one this big. This is a simple heavy-duty cast iron pan that gets the job done and the food tastes great. It looked very well seasoned when I bought it but I like to season my own Cast iron Pans so I just added layers on top of the pan as soon as I got it. Food tastes great and this pan will last me  forever This 12\" iron skillet from Lodge is quality-made and durable, about half the price of the best-known French brand with the fancy-coloured outside coating.It\\'s much tougher than non-stick pans and endures much higher temperatures. You can even use it in the oven as a roaster, on 200C for a couple of hours which of course for tefal would be unthinkable. I\\'ve oven-cooked meat on it, and found it great for roasting potatoes. The reason it\\'s so good is the heat-retaining properties of the tough natural iron. Once heated, it takes ages to cool down again and this is great for cooking almost anything. If you\\'re using oil it remains hot much longer so the food tastes better.As a fry-pan it\\'s not as non-stick as Teflon but I found if you season it, it\\'s then almost as good. You season it by coating the inside with oil, then baking it in the oven for an hour which binds the oil molecules to the iron so they won\\'t wash out - just like a traditional wok. In any case if you use a metal spatula/fish slice, then the food moves no problem. The pan seems to get better non-stick properties the more it\\'s used.Caution: these iron pans are heavy compared to similar-sized teflon-coated aluminium pans, so the larger ones are more difficult to lift and use if you\\'re light of frame. But on the plus side, they should last a lifetime of use. I absolutely love this skillet.  This was my first cast iron piece, so I spent ages reading up on how to season/maintain and all that.  I didn\\'t buy it on Amazon, but wanted to share my experience with it and hope that it helps someone.First, the pre-seasoning is not very useful.  It doesn\\'t form a very stable base-layer, and frankly, it is quite sticky which defeats the purpose of having a seasoning layer.  Get rid of it using steel wool (in this case just the inside cooking surface, don\\'t bother scrubbing the outside) or the self-clean cycle of your oven.I have to clarify something for those of you who are new to cast iron:  this will NOT match the performance of true \"non stick\" cookware.  But it will cook nicer (than the cheap stuff anyway), and will last longer than 100 of those non-stick pieces put together (literally, not exaggerating, cast iron cookware can last for well over 100 years if not abused too badly).  And it looks great!Cast iron holds heat.  It doesn\\'t respond quickly to temperature changes, so don\\'t get the pan too hot and try to save the food by lowering the heat. It won\\'t work.ALWAYS PREHEAT your cast iron before putting food in. And your food should be near room temperature too, don\\'t dump cold or frozen food in, it will stick more.  Properly preheating your pan and warming up your food will reduce stickiness by a whole lot.  I never use more than 1 tsp oil or other fat in my pans when cooking, and that is already a lot, I often use less.How to season it:I\\'m going to depart from the norm and advise against oven-seasoning.  Why?  Because the times I\\'ve done it it has failed on me eventually (seasoning flaked off), it takes ages, and it wastes a lot of energy.What I recommend you do instead, is similar to what the Chinese and the French recommend you do in cast iron/carbon steel cookware (and they really know what they\\'re doing when it comes to food and cookware).  You heat the unseasoned skillet up very hot on the range (600F ish, don\\'t go TOO overboard with the heat), dump a small piece, about 3/4tsp, of lard into it (or a slab of pork fat from the Asian market), swirl the pan around to coat the surface, it will be VERY smoky, so open all windows and turn on extractor fans and any other fans you might have.  Then wipe the lard out with a tissue or towel, let it smoke for half a minute, wipe again with the oily tissue to coat the pan again, all the time maintaining the high heat.  Repeat this until the tissue/towel is dry, then dump another small piece of lard in and repeat.  Use about 3-4 pieces of lard, then finally wipe the pan dry with a clean tissue, let it heat for another minute or so, then turn off the heat and let it cool.I did this method then tried frying an egg with a little bit of butter, zero stick.  Keep in mind this was a completely newly seasoned pan, with the \"pebble\" finish that so many complain about.This method of seasoning also produces a nicer looking layer of seasoning than the oven method in my experience. Love this pan for eggs and smaller items like garlic cloves, chopped onions, etc..It\\'s held up well, just be sure you know how to care for it. I didn\\'t even look for another brand. Lodge has my confidence and it has been sustained by using their cast iron pans. I don\\'t often need to cook in cast iron, but when I do, I want a great pan. So I choose Lodge pans as they are simply the best. This skillet is a 15 inch skillet.  Too big for the cupboard, so I keep it in the oven.  It is heavy.  It is pre-seasoned, and does a terrific job when cooking chicken or ribs or almost anything.  Nothing can beat the Lodge Cast Iron Cookware.  It was inexpensive, and it will last longer than I will.  A really great product that can be used on the cooktop, or the oven, or even in the barbecue.  I love it. I live alone and this 8&#34; cast iron skillet is the perfect size pan for me. I use it for everything. It fits great in my Cuisinart convection toaster oven. it also works good for making small pizzas. I have used this for quiche, macaroni and cheese, home made scalloped potatoes, pan searing tuna, salmon, lamb shanks, baking chicken wings....you name it.  I am absolutely in love with this pan. I am thinking of purchasing the lid to make it a mini dutch oven. it is a great size pan and an absolute powerhouse workhorse for the kitchen. it came pre-seasoned and I have not had any rusting yet. I just keep it clean, dry, and oiled at all times.  If you have tough food left in it just put water in it and bring to a slow boil for a few minutes. from there you should be able to clean it out easily with a cast iron brush. Pre-seasoning on this skillet was kind of a joke. I\\'m a complete newbie to iron skillets, so I didn\\'t understand this. However, after proper seasoning, I\\'m quite happy with this product. We use it to make fried chicken, cook bacon, make gravy and all sorts of other wonderful things. The fact that it\\'s 12 inches makes it large enough to cook a good amount of food when entertaining others.We are quite pleased with our purchase and as a young couple trying to learn all the new cooking techniques we can, this was a great addition to our arsenal of pots and pans! I had always wanted a cast-iron skillet.  Now I have one and love it!  I like the way it cooks and how surprisingly easy it is to clean!  A little extra effort shortly after cooking in it, and it should last me a lifetime! I have used this pan now for a year.  If you are unfamiliar with Cast Iron Cooking see all the tips for cleaning so you don\\'t ruin the value of the original Seasoning.  I use this for all recipes, my cakes are fantastic!  & Pizza:  press the dough and add the toppings... 20 minutes and it is Fantastic.  Add the salads and what a great meal.I also use [2]  10&#34; pans for individual pizza.  NO MORE TEFLON!!!  I soooo wish I\\'d known - 15 years ago! When you know how to use a cast iron skillet properly, it is one of the best cooking tools you will ever use.Cons:- Heavy- Handle gets hot- Must be cleaned and seasoned properly- Can break (or may break something) if dropped- Not good for boiling water- Not dishwasher safePros:- Lasts a lifetime (or several) with proper care (far longer than any other nonstick pan)- Excellent nonstick surface- Non toxic- A source of iron in your food (it\\'s good for you!)- Can use in oven or on stove opt- Easily recycled if it breaks (it is solid iron)- Works well on induction stove tops- Great for the environment (sustainable)- Usually cleans easily with little or no soap (!)- Much less expensive compared to many alternativesFor me the benefits far outweigh the costs. ATK rated, and it works just like they reviewed. Read the directions, and following the cleaning instructions! Great for steaks, eggs, potatoes, and anything that needs a good sear. Great value and size. You simply cannot substitute anything else for a good cast iron skillet. This one will last forever and it\\'s the only one you can buy that\\'s still made in the US. Another quality Lodge cast iron product. Perfect for cooking for one or two people or for side dishes. We got this at the Lodge outlet store with a very minor defect for a couple bucks. With a little TLC this skillet will last forever. Great for cooking bacon, sausage, steak.Came well seasoned and getting more so with each use.Handle is a little too short. Would like another 1&#34; to it, but perhaps that is more opinion than not.Best to have the handle and outside grab handle as well.Does not scratch my glass stove.I would not cook eggs in it even if they show egg graphics on the label! After many replacement non-stick pans I finally learned how to use a cast iron pan and love them.  I have a 12\", 10\" and 8\" and I use them for everything.  They are HEAVY, that\\'s the only negative thing.  I oiled it before the first use and spray it lightly before every use.  Never use soap or chemicals on them.  They are better than all the fancy non-stick pans I\\'ve purchased in the past.  I make eggs, omelets, pancakes, steaks, pork chops, cornbread, you name it, I make it in the cast iron skillets.  I\\'ve compared this with a Calphalon professional non-stick pan side by side making pan cakes and the iron pan cooks faster at a lower temperature because the pan holds heat so much better.  It\\'s great for frittata because after the stovetop, I just stick it in the pre-heated oven to firm up the top.  Makes excellent German Apple Pancakes because you can saut&eacute; the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon and butter; then pour the batter on top and stick the whole thing in the oven to puff up.  Easy clean up, hot water and a plastic scrubber, then I tilt it to air dry, I do not get rust spots because our water is so hot that it dries within a minute.I\\'m getting one for my nephew to make his morning eggs. Nice little cast Iron pan. It\\'s perfect for Breakfast Sausage and frying single servings of chicken patties. (Dont have to use a lot of oil.) Word of advice, get a handle mitt because the pan is small and moves around a lot. Also, make sure you have a metal spatula.Ok course, it took a few meals to break the pan in. Once you use it a few times with oil, and clean and oil it up enough, it is stick free. This pan is used daily at my house. I make breakfast in it.(Pancakes, bacon, omlettes/scrambled/fried eggs and more) I make lunch with it. (Hamburgers, grilled cheese, etc.)And I make dinner in it. (Deep Dish Pizza, corn bread, fried foods, frozen foods layed out and baked in the oven...) THe list goes on. I even make dessert in it. (Apple pie is great baked in the cast iron.) I use it once a day or multiple times a day. I just love it. And the best part is the simple clean up! Simply run under hot water and if necessary wipe out with a steel wool.I have a few different sized pans, as well as a variety of seasoned and unseasoned.By far this 10\" is the best. It is not too heavy, and just the right size for just about anything I make. I also like that seasoned look and it is smoother than the unseasoned. All round it is the best kichen tool I have ever purchased.I also think that having the extra iron in my diet is a plus! UPDATE: I\\'ve had this pan for 7 years now, and for the first several years, only used it for steaks. I would heat it up (outside on my portable burner) until glowing white/gray (which I thought would burn the seasoning off!), and then throw my steak in--it would smoke like mad and the meat would turn BLACK (love blackened steaks!) But this did wonderful things for the seasoning--the interior became glossy smooth and good Lord, nowadys I used this skillet for everything from scrambled eggs to veggies--nothing STICKS in the least and the flavor is incredible! This is what our grandmothers raved about! Finally, I have it! Everyday hard use and abuse is what REAL seasoning is about!___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I had to buy this online, because good luck trying to find this size in any retail store...! The tiny 8\" (with a 6\" cooking surface) is everywhere, as is the 10.5\" (which I have and love), but this size is perfect for a single steak or small meals for one person. I like blackened steaks, getting the pan beyond searing hot, and so this is a great little dedicated steak pan that I can get so hot it almost carbonizes the seasoning off, and I don\\'t have to worry about using it for anything else. However that hasn\\'t happened yet, despite getting the pan up to 850F  over a high BTU gas burner, and having some incredible steaks (with lots of black smoke!) Kudos to Lodge for a very well done pre-seasoning process.This pan did come with some noticable and unsightly cast iron crap (over-spill) from the casting process, attached to the top lip in one area. Personally the blemish is bad enough, I would have rejected it and sent it through the discounted seconds route (ie Marshals/ TJ Max), but I guess that the QA is not that strong at Lodge. However the pan is so easy to use since it is Pre-seasoned, and been so useful for my steak cooking (and I have even scrambled eggs with no sticking), that I forgive Lodge the cosmetic blemishes even though I paid full retail + shipping.The logic Pre-seasoned line is really that good. You will still need to season it slowly, over time, for it to be like our grandmothers age-old seasoning was like on their Griswolds and Wagners, but it\\'s a great start.For frying and searing, cast iron just cannot be beat. It gets HOT and stays HOT. Plus the Lodge products (flawed as they may be) are really superior to many of the cheaper cast iron pans coming in from China (that are pre-seasoned or coated with God-knows-what! Look what they did with pet food!) This skillet is big and heavy.  We use it once every couple of weeks but when we need it it works fine.  This is replacing our large non-stick skillet and is working out well other than needing a lid, nothing we have will fit. I bought this to do high heat cooking that I did not want to do in my All Clad pans.  This pan works well for this purpose.  The pre-seasoned finish also works well.  A great pan for the money. Lodge is THE name brand for cast iron skillets in the United States.  They make the best pans, period.  It has worked perfectly so far, I will take care of it, and I expect to get many years of good use out of this pan.  I am a happy camper. This is the cast iron pan I go to for most of my skillet needs, good size and great performance. Relatively non-stick when clean. Season it regularly, clean it with water (no soap) and a cast iron scrubber, and keep it oiled. Love this frying pan from Lodge. As usual Lodge Logic proves to be an awesome product. Keep it seasoned and it will last a lifetime. Perfect for the one person omelet, frying up 3 eggs, or the single grilled cheese. I also have a 10&#34; and 12&#34; cast iron pan for my collection. I highly recommend Cooks great, no sticking, seasoned well! Couldn\\'t have got a better gift for my sister! She cooks everything in her skillet! I have never purchased anything from the Lodge line of cookware.  I bought the 12\" Cast Iron skillet on Amazon and was honestly a little concerned with what kind of quality I would be getting because the price was so low.I love this skillet!  It\\'s really a perfect cast iron skillet.  I am constantly destroying my skillets and thought cast iron might be smart for me.  I purchased this a couple months ago and have used it multiple times.  I burnt the crap out of a blackberry cobbler last week and was worried I had damaged my pan.  The sugar was completely scorched.  A stiff brush and some hot water and this thing was good as new (the poor cobbler wasn\\'t so save-able).  If this thing can stand up to me, it can stand up to anything!I now realize I do need to improve my upper body strength :)  The Lodge 12\" Skillet is very, very heavy.  Not a complaint, it should be heavy - but I do have a little trouble getting it in and out of my oven.  If it didn\\'t have the extra handle, I would not be able to lift this pan at all.Awesome quality, great price, smart design - of all the items in my kitchen, this pan is my favorite. Partially seasoned. These skillets need additional seasoning for their full cooking potential. Easy to do. Instead of baking the skillets for hours, just fry  foods in them 2 or 3 times...chicken, fries, fish or  stir fry with oil. No special kind of oil is needed. Whatever is normally used  for frying or stir frying will work just fine. The skillet arrives with a greyish black color.  After frying in it just once, the skillet will turn completely black and gets better with each subsequent use.Excellent quality cast iron.  I purchased the 15\".  It huge. Perfect for frying without \"crowding\". This size also makes a  wonderful deep dish pizza pan. This size will hold enough cornbread batter to feed half an army. Amazing little skillet. Cook everything in it and nothing stick. But I make sure to always season after each use, as suggested by some of the reviews. I\\'m looking to order a larger size. ok, it is heavy. I wanted this for making big batches of stuff. In this regard it comes up short. While 17\" wide, it is shallower than my Calphalon 12\" skillet, and, while the pan is 17\" wide at the top, it is only ~14\" at the inside of the pan bottom. The result is that I doubt if it is much bigger volume-wise that the Calphalon, but it has more bottom for browning, etc. So, why do I like it so much? Cast iron. I was browning some chicken and the browning was fantastic - lots of beautiful stuff on the pan which turned into delicious sauce. Cleaning was a bit different from non-stick. Seemed easy to clean, but needed oiling. Second time didn\\'t use dishsoap (Ew?) and it came out perfect. I recommend it. I\\'d seen some cast iron in stores and didn\\'t much like what I saw. When I got this item, the cooking surface was smooth and ready. I fully intend to get a couple of other cast iron items from this seller / manufacturer. I recommend this item. I am realy pleased with the quality for the price. I had recently spent $50 and was so dissapointed with another brand .Update------------------------------I\\'m still loving my cast Iron pan its been over a year now and I just wanted togive 2 tidbits of advice. I have found butter to be better than oil for keeping the pan seasoned. I do wash my pan with a sponge with very diluted soap then I set it over the stove and light the fire for 2 min this drys out the pan to prevent rust and then I add a little butter just when I turn off the flame.I use a paper towl and carefully wipe the butter around the hot pan. The heat lets the butter penetrate a bit. The butter does not leave a sticky feeling to the pan like oil does.When I first got my pan I let it soak and accidently forgot about it overnight it rusted badly just in 1 night bud I was able to bring it back to life. I never soak now for more than 5-10 minutes and only if I must.If Something got superstuck add water to pan and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Season well after.I also found that scrubbing with salt did not work well at all and was very wasteful. The diluted soap and the above treatment works perfectly. I have one of the Lodge Miniature cast iron spoon rests that I cook with  on a routine basis. Wal Mart sold them as ashtrays; it\\'s never had that use in my house. This is perfect for a single serving size of egg, sausage, etc. For making biscuts or serving cornbread for each place setting, children and adults alike go crazy over them. And cast iron is easy to clean and maintain. I grew up with it.I gotta try the garlic and olive oil idea- it sounds fantastic.For cuteness, nothing beats these items. There isn\\'t any way to describe what happens when I take these off the wall hooks, oil and fill them with batter and pop them in the oven in front of guests. They hold nearly a quarter cup of liquid, so I fill them with BBQ sauce after making cornbread and give each guest their own sauce pot. They go crazy for them.Absolutely nothing cooks like cast iron. I\\'ll be ordering them throughout this year as 2009\\'s Christmas list gifts. My friends will LOVE it!For those disappointed with the size, Lodge and Amazon make it clear these are minatures and give the size. Season them properly, take care of them and they\\'ll last forever. I received this and the handle was completely broken off. The skillet is fairly heavy and Amazon just put it loose in a box with some paper. The packaging didn\\'t protect it at all! I have returned it and will try ordering one again to see if I can get a good one.I\\'m leary of skillets shipped by Amazon though. They may be weakened due to lack of proper packaging. You may be better off buying one locally because even if it looks fine when you receive it, it could be structurally damaged and end up cracking later... I bought this for myself for a Christmas gift and I\\'ve used it about 5 times in the week I\\'ve had it.  Great for frying chicken, bacon, hash browns, eggs - you name it.  Lots of great cast iron skillet recipes on the Lodge website too.  I can\\'t wait to try out the corn bread and pan pizza recipes. This thing is very fun. I love finding new ways to use it. And of course, cleanup is a breeze. James,Eventually the surface of your new cast iron skillet will smooth out, the more seasoning build up on your skillet the smoother the surface will becomeThe old cast iron was machined polished, we stopped polishing cookware in 1997If you do not want to wait on the seasoning to smooth out the surface, you may sandpaper the bottom of the skillet and re season immediatelySandpaper 200/300 grainThank You,Amanda GholstonCustomer ServiceLodge ManufacturingMay I add, I use a stainless steel scouring pad, not steel wool, just stainless on my pan every time I wash it and it is gradually getting smoother and smoother. I have a very old pan that is like glass and expect this one to get there eventually. In the meantime, it\\'s still totally non-stick already so don\\'t let a little roughness bother you. This is a fantastic pan - don\\'t spend more for expensive pans. It came seasoned - just wash after using, dry immediately and put in a warm oven to dry out. This skillet from Lodge is truly \"pre-seasoned\" and performs as advertized. Looking forward to purchasing other sizes from them in the future. Also, they are \"made in America\", which is a plus! This cast iron fry pan arrived in excellent shape and it was well packaged.  It arrived more quickly than I expected.  My husband loved it. I have had one of these 10 1/4\" skillets for several years. When I got it the first thing I did was season it some more (it came pre-seasoned) which is very easy. What I like best about it is that it sears meat really well, and you can cut cornbread or steak in it without worrying about damaging the finish. Cast iron never goes bad. You can always take all the old seasoning off and redo it. I also have a 15\" Lodge skillet, and I love that for large roasts or just feeding a large crew. This doesn\\'t work as well on the ceramic cooktop because of the heat ring, but it helps to straddle 2 burners with it. I have more expirementing to do with this and see how is disperses the heat. I suspect that it will always be a great deal hotter right over the burner. And yes you can use cast iron on ceramic cooktops. Just don\\'t drop them. I recommend using 2 hands when moving the big 15\" pan. I always wanted a cast iron skillet like my \"nanny\" had-her burgers & steak were always the best. But, they were soooo expensive. This is perfecct- reasonably priced- small but large enough for a \"1 person meal\" and PRE-SEASONED...It\\'s great! I am ready to ditch my all-clad non-stick pans, and this is the perfect replacement. I want to stop using non-stick pans due to my fears of the non-stick coating coming off and uncertain health risks. Since this pan comes pre seasoned, it took very little effort but to wash it according to the directions and begin using it right away. I\\'ve already used it to cook scrambled and fried eggs, make pancakes, sear shrimp and steak, saute vegetables, and make a cream sauce. Since the pan is so heavy, I just leave it on my stove, and in doing so, it\\'s what I use for whatever I cook. I could not be happier. It\\'s perfect for everything I\\'ve made thus far. The 12 inch really is perfect for my family of 4. I\\'ve only had one instance where my food stuck, and that was because I failed to heat up the pan enough and add enough oil. Clean up is a cinch. Most often, I\\'ll just wipe down with a clean paper towel and swipe canola oil on the surface. When it\\'s filled with sauce or has stuck on food, I followed the direction of washing with hot water and a stiff brush. It will be my go to pan and I see myself using it daily. You won\\'t be disappointed with this pan. It beats all my $100+ all clad non-stick and stainless steel pans, but ten years ago when I bought those pans there were no preseason cast iron pans available for someone like me incapable of properly seasoning it myself. My husband likes to fry bacon and morel mushrooms and he missed using an iron skillet. I was skeptical as to whether it would work on our glass to stove.  Much to his delight I works just fine, heats up evenly and came well seasoned so we could use it right out of the box. I will be ordering some other sizes as well. This is great for kids who love to cook. Single egg size, garlic roaster, working toy, paper weight or decoration. Same lodge quality you expect, mini sized.For those still wondering what to do with this mini skillet or the five inch one, excuse me while I jump up and down in excitement about making mini skillet pies with my munchkins on this fine snow day. Not enough mini skillets? No problem, order more. Just kidding, use a muffin tin for the rest but don\\'t miss out on a super cute kid sized pie. Glad I have this tiny one plus two 5\" skillets for a fun winter day. Mini pies are all the rage, why not a mini skillet pie too. Can\\'t get any cuter than that! I was surprised by the size when it arrived.  The outer diameter is around 6.5\" but the cooking surface is about 4.5\".  Still, its not too small.  Thank God, I thought of getting the miniature skillet instead of this!! I think its good for 1 omelette or cookie or pancake.  I\\'m using it for seasoning spices, called as \"Tadka\" or \"Thaalippu\" as in Indian cuisine - very ideal.But the pre-seasoned finish was more brown than black along with some tiny pores.  But then, just after 2 uses, it is trying to look somewhat black with the application of oil.  I followed the instructions that came with the skillet.  Also, the glue that sticks the instructions card to the skillet came out well as if it was a non-stick pan (Somewhere in some lodge reviews, I read that the glue was scoured out of the pan causing discoloration).And GUESS WHAT......I got it for FREE....YES, as part of the 4-for-3 promotion.  That\\'s the best thing about this skillet.  It came in along with 2 other stuff neatly packaged and was on time. THANKS Amazon.... but it takes awhile for the food to stop sticking, other wise I recommend, nice and sturdy, not too heavy, just the right size for single meals. I bought three of these pans here on Amazon. They came well packed and were shipped right away. They are perfect to bake sweet and savoury pies. The pans are quite deep and allow for a good stuffed pie for 4 servings. I also use them to make omelettes, and to saute tofu and vegetables.The price is right and shipping is free. You won\\'t go wrong on this. That basically says it all.  The safest, most economical way to cook.  And the preseasoning is good, doesn\\'t need to be scrubbed off like others (although yes, I do heat my pans up before cooking - read the instructions that come with it) just heavy cooks great clean up is easy and the  lid fits perfecttly i ould recommend it for everyone :) This \"seasoned\" pan is sensational.  I size my pans to my cooktop burner size and the heat distribution is perfect.  I have my concerns on the teflon coatings breaking down. I rinse in hot water and wipe with lint free cotton towel. Who needs dumbbells to work out your arms when you have this pan?!  Beautiful quality.  I use this pan almost daily.  I am thankful for the double handles, though! Only way to cook buttermilk bisquits.  Yumm.  Tried the other day, guess I lost my original pan, they just didn\\'t cook good, so I went to Amazon...wham they were there. my perfect little fried egg pan (or small amount of veggies, sausage, w/e)can\\'t wait to make some cornbread in it! This skillet is perfection in my kitchen. I absolutely love it and being pre-seasoned was a bonus. Having a handle on both sides was a good feature, too. I\\'ve owned cast iron skillets before, but they were always hand-me-downs and I wanted one that I had started from new, so when I got my skillet for my birthday last year, I was thrilled.Even though it came \"pre seasoned\", I still went the extra step and seasoned it some more.  The result is that I can cook stuff in it and very little of it sticks...and if it does, it\\'s not so bad I can\\'t get it off with a bare minimum of work.And everything just tastes better after being cooked in a cast iron skillet...fried eggs, chicken, grilled cheese, etc.After use, I bring it over to the sink and run it, still hot, under very hot water and scrub with a long handled scrub brush made for this purpose.  No soap or abrasive cleaners of any kind.  Then I put it back on the stove...burner off..and let it dry during the meal.  Once dry, I pour in a bit of vegetable oil, swish it around with a paper towel, and wipe up the excess and hang it on my pot rack till next time.Another way of cleaning is to let it cool, put water in, heat on the stove and then transfer it all to the sink where, again, using very hot water and no soap, I scrub the bits out.  I then allow it to dry on the burner (turned off) and reseason with oil when it\\'s dry.I know it sounds like a lot of work, but really, it\\'s much quicker and easier than some of my other pots and pans...even the so-called \"non-stick\" ones.I love the weight of it and the feeling of durability...properly cared for, these things should probably last a hundred years or more. Years ago I \\'upgraded\\' (young me, then) and got rid of my cast iron cooking pans, and for years I\\'ve been sorry, but didn\\'t want to spend more money re-purchasing.  Something finally made me decide to buy this one - partially because these days all the pans are pre-seasoned, and partially because this one was made in USA.  I\\'ve used it a few times so far, and find it is really better than my old pan, and I\\'m a happy (older and wiser?) person. I just started getting into cast iron cooking and it is much better than anything else I have used. I only have one old cast iron skillet and it is much smoother than these but I assume over time these will get much much better. Don\\'t try cooking an egg as your first test lol. I cooked a lot of bacon in mine before I attempted any eggs. We bought this skillet to knock would-be burglars over the head.  Seriously though, this is a great skillet.  It cooks well on an electric burner, although it is so heavy it might knock the burner out of the socket!  You will need two hands to move this around.  Hamburger tastes better than a normal pan and most anything tastes better and cooks better on the skillet.  This might help with some extra iron in your diet if you\\'re anemic.Cleaning: Clean immediately after use with soap and a sponge.  Use a PLASTIC spatula to scrape off remains.  Dry.  Then oil the whole thing with any type of cooking oil with a light coat.  Don\\'t use any kind of metal utensil upon it\\'s surface.  Follow this and it won\\'t rust.Made in the USA. So, I offered it to my daughter who was thrilled and said she\\'d have a lot of uses for it.  Other than being small it seemed fine. We use a lot of cast iron in our house and I bought this one because my 12 inch was just a little over kill for most jobs.  This pan is great for a few pieces of bacon and eggs in the morning and many other jobs where I really don\\'t need a large pan.  Need to cook bacon or other fatty foods in it to help with the surface to achieve a good non stick status.  I render my own lard and use it on many saut&eacute;ing projects which helps to get my pans up to the level I like them I think everyone already knows that these are 5 star products.  If you don\\'t love cast iron, then you don\\'t know how to cook.  If anyone ever tells you they love their skillet, it\\'s probably cast iron. This thing is heavy.  It\\'s not that bad to clean, just buy some steal wool and some crisco to put on it after your done cleaning.  You can let grease from bacon and other fatty meats just sit in it, and then cook with that grease next time around.  I like that its made in america too.  Seems like this is one of the only cast iron brands that you can buy, they\\'ve done it right! This pan was larger than I had expected, it\\'s a great size. I used it as soon as I got it, cooked up some hamburgers, got a nice sear on it. And this thing holds heat like a BEAST. I can see it being perfect for doing fish, pork chop sandwiches, or any other kind of masculine food that I eat.A+++++++ I use this tiny little skillet almost daily during the winter to quickly melt small amounts of coconut oil.  (Coconut oil turns solid anytime the temperature falls below the high 60s.) I picked it up at whole foods and thought it would be perfect for melting butter in after making stove-top pop corn and it is.  I liked the small shall size because my other melting pan was too deep at 2 cups.  I just wish it didn\\'t already come pre-seasoned.  I don\\'t understand why they bothered doing that.  Seasoning a cast iron pan yourself is really easy.  I like to season my cast iron pans with coconut oil given the chance. I have purchased several Lodge Products. This skillet is by far the busiest pan in my kitchen. I use it daily.I love to cook, and this skillet is so versatile. I can sear steaks, make sauces, and wilt greens. I can simmer gravy, reduce pie filling, and fry eggs. All in this skillet.I have a smaller skillet for light jobs, but the 12 inch is perfect for everything. I am cooking for two, but this skillet will easily accommodate more. Plus, if you love to cook, but don\\'t have a large family, I urge you to get this large skillet. You will use it, I promise. Handy smaller cast iron pan for the oven...Great to make that smaller meal all in one pan when I bake in the oven...Used by restaurants for single servings a lot too....The best for mac & cheese...gooey buns...and any single serving...The cast iron pan takes a few minutes to heat up before you start to avoid sticking messes when used on the stove top...and clean up easy just wash it out while it is hot the food usually slides off...then re-season the pan with oil while it is still warm and it is ready for the next use....Makes great corn bread too....Eggs this is just the right pan...No real draw backs it is a small cast iron pan what more can be said.. I use this skillet for cooking bacon and most of my meat. It is fantastic for creating a nice browning on chicken, pork, steak, etc. This skillet is so good it makes me cook more often. I have never been more happy with a $10 purchase in my lifetime.You will need to season the skillet, or any new cast iron skillet, yourself. There are plenty of sources on the Internet for how to do this. I recommend checking SeriousEats if you need help. I primarily bought cast iron cookware to escape Teflon, but I found that it\\'s been a fun addition to our kitchen.  Though it requires grease, I find seasoned cast-iron just as non-stick as Teflon.  Further, one never need worry about scratching. I\\'ve been using this pan daily for the past year.  I absolutely love it.  I did learn that peanut oil doesn\\'t work quite as well as canola oil for my daily omelet.  I sometime get little bits that stick in the pan, but the cleanup is easy enough.  As the instructions state, starchy foods are going to be a problem.  So potatoes, rice, pasta, etc, need to be cooked in a different pan.  Acidic foods, like tomato sauce, will take the seasoning off.  I stick to eggs, meats, veggies, and pancakes in this pan, with no complaints. This a great bargin at around $20. I had mine for over a year and it cooks everything great. Some people complain that it is not as smooth as an old Griswold or Wagner which is true since I also own a few of these skillets but with added seasoning they even out nicely. Lodge products are a great value on Amazon and over the past year I bought the 5 qt Dutch oven (which I love), round griddle (makes the best pancakes), square grill pan and fajita set. These have become our \"go to\" cookware over some of the so called \"highend\" stuff we own. We also did away with our teflon pans. Cleans beautifully, preseasoned, just the right size, and it comes with the hot handle!  I couldn\\'t love it more!  Just wiped it down after use, and oiled it again.  It\\'s gorgeous.  It\\'s cast iron.  It\\'s exactly what it should be. Lodge have never let me down. I have several pieces and they all performvery well. Great size for baking or frying. I don\\'t know what I would do with out this Pan The LODGE-LOGIC 12 inch Pre-Seasoned, is the one I use the most, it came Pre-Seasoned so I didn\\'t have to do anything to it, is the Pan I reach for when I\\'m about to fry or cook anything and nothing sticks to it, and it suppose to be healthier for you. I wash it by hand, Towel dry and do not use any Soap or Detergent and sometimes while is warm I wipe a light coat of vegetable oil all over it; I want to keep building the non-stick surface. I love it,...Granny was Right! Thank You I did the inside and outside surfaces with lard and placed it in the oven upside down for 1 hour at 350 Deg. F., I only wash it in hot water when cleaning it and put in on the stove after drying it out, turn the burner on for 3 Min., apply peanut oil all around the indide of the pan and it\\'s ready to use again with no rust forming. I have had one of these forever. I use it for frying single eggs, and melting butter. If you buy a set, it is perfect for serving single servings of baked deserts - like a country-style shallow ramekin. I don\\'t cook mini/novelty foods, but it would be great for that. It takes up no space, it is indestructible if you keep it dry, and it is just right for a few things.Cast iron is great stuff. When properly cared for, it is the original non-stick, with no weird industrial chemicals.These pans will outlive you, and they are made in the USA. I kept hearing the statement that cast iron was \"the original non-stick pan\".I used this pan to cook some eggs after I bought it with horrible results.Then, I started cooking meats (steak pork chops, etc) in it. What a difference that made in my pan! The more I used it after that, the more everything slid off of it like it was made of glass.This pan has a permanent spot on top of my stove now. What\\'s more, it\\'s the most reliable pan I have that goes from stove-top to oven, and back.The other great thing about it is that you can bring it along with your dutch oven on your camping trips to cook over an open fire/coals.As far as the heft (weight) of this thing goes, if anyone doesn\\'t understand what cast iron is all about, they shouldn\\'t be buying it. The biggest reason for that heft is heat retention. There is NOTHING better!If they made the handle any longer, it would have the tendency to break, and then everyone would complain about that. I doubt that anyone complaining about the handle ever thought about that. First I lightly oiled with veggie oil and baked 1 hour to make sure it was ready to use.To make cornbread:------------------------------Heat pan on stove (medium high heat), add2 TBSP of real butter to melt the butter. Pour in the cornbread batter, remove from stove and bake as directed.For some reason the cast iron makes a great crust on the cornbread.This pan is just the right size for cornbread. Its heavy, but if you can handle the weight, its prefect size for steaks.10-12inch is ok for one or 2 small pieces, 15inch is prefect and also retain heat better per the big mass. You have to prepare this before using, after that just make sure you clean it well (without soap) and it\\'ll be great! I use it for everything from breads to omlets to curries. Cast iron is perfect for making a great steak in your home.  It evenly heats the steak and allows you to sear in the flavor.Some note about the skillet:Its large and heavy, many people will need two hands to move it.  It has two handles for the reason.It also has pour sides so that you can pour our the juices or any liquids you use.Do not soap your dish.  It will ruin its finish and rust!Always have some veggie oil available.  It will keep it from rusting and allow for years of use. You cant beat this price for a seasoned skillet.  I also bought a cook book for it and it came with tips on keeping this guy seasoned and how to cook better with it since Im kind of a goon at why these are better than other pans.  Ive used it for casseroles and the food did taste better than when i used my pyrex glass thingy. We love this skillet. Meat and vegetables browned on the cast iron skillet taste way better that from the non stick pan. This skillet was well seasoned out of the box, so we only have to keep covering it inside with a thin film of oil after each use.The 13.25 inch size is perfect, we can reuse the lid we had for our non stick 13 inch pan.The silicone handles help a lot, because the thing is heavy. One of my favorite items! Works great, makes your food even more tasty, great size. Sturdy, not too heavy, great for the oven as well as for top. Love it! I grew up using cast iron skillets. This one is the biggest one out of the three that I already have. I have not seen any defects. I have fried chicken and other things in it. I like it because I can pick it up using both hands since it has a place to grip the other end. What a pleasure to cook with this little skillet. Before purchasing this, my only cast iron was the 12 inch skillet, but, because of its size, I hardly ever used it. It weighs 100 pounds and the cooking surface looks like an asphalt parking lot.But THIS little beauty is the perfect size and weight for cooking for one. I use it every day. According to another reviewer, Joe Bob (Lodge Logic L8SK3 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet), if your skillet feels a little sticky or tacky and food sticks, it\\'s because it wasn\\'t seasoned at a high enough temp so the first thing I did was wash this with a drop of dish washing liquid and add to the pre-seasoning. After a thin coating of shortening, I baked it upside-down for an hour at 500 degrees and it\\'s been non-stick ever since. Within the first couple days, I made cornbread, fried and scrambled eggs, and potatoes and onions and nothing stuck. Of course, as y\\'all know (and now I know), the real selling point for cast iron cooking is that food tastes 100% better. I thought about giving my Teflon and other \"non-sticks\" to my enemies, but that\\'s just mean. When I first purchased this, my husband asked if I intended to use it as a weapon. Not yet, but it\\'s sturdy enough to get the job done if needed. :-) This pan is the perfect size for people who like to back pack or camp. Its big enough to fit most meals, fish, steaks, bacon. I always bring it when i go out camping if im going to fish. Its comes ready to eat, i would recommond making some bacon in it before taking it out camping. Just use warm water and a light scrubing pad to make sure the pan stays seasoned. Its a little heavy to carry, but worth it if you like cooking anything in it. After loving the performance of myLodge Logic Dutch Oven with loop handles, I knew the next thing I wanted to pick up was a good-sized cast iron skillet.  I own a few cast iron pans inherited from my grandma, but they were all on the smaller size and I wanted something that could handle a couple of steaks side-by-side.This 12-inch Skillet is a bit of a monster, heavy to wield and almost unmanageable once it is down on the stove, but it delivers some great flavor. Even though I love my Calphalon non-stick pans as well, for putting a crust on a seared steak cast iron can\\'t be beat.  Plus, it can go straight off the stove top into the oven for a nice quick finish of the middle.\"Lodge Logic\" puts out really nice cast iron cookware, at a reasonable price.  I was thrilled with my Dutch Oven, and now I am thrilled with my Skillet as well. Take everyone\\'s advice on seasoning it, and you will have a pan for a lifetime.  Or maybe even a couple of lifetimes, when your grandkids inherit it. this thing is huge, but i love it and it really comes in handy. you can easily cook 5 pounds of ground beef at a time in it (with room to stir!), and because it\\'s cast iron, even tho it\\'s much bigger than my burner, it cooks pretty evenly. highly recommend This is a great item to use at home or to take along with you on your camping trips. I have used in on my range at home and cooking over the fire. You need to purchase one of these. I have a 15&#34; lodge skillet and this one is a great deal smaller, obviously lol, but its PERFECT for customizing pasta sauces, making a few eggs at a time, if using more than 3 id say get a larger size. But fits a bottle of pasta sauce and is great for roasting some garlic before adding onions and the sauce. Great buy!!! Since I know this will last a lifetime! I use this skillet every week. I expect I\\'ll continue to do so for the rest of my life. Skillet.'"

       "'I\\'ve always bought the regular Lodge skillets and loved them.  Went with the pre-seasoned this time because I wanted this size.Wow, what a pain.  I picked the best I could find from a stack on a big-box store shelf, so I know I didn\\'t get a lemon (unless the whole batch was badly pre-seasoned!).  The coating flaked off, got my hands black, and smelled really rusty.  No WAY I could cook with it that way!It has taken me about five rounds of boiling soapy water and then vinegar and water to get most of that nasty coating off of there with a steel scurbber.  (Then I seasoned by coating with oil and heating in the oven for 20 minutes.I\\'m still wary of that residue.  Never have I seen (and smelled) so much rust (trapped UNDER the coating) come off a skillet--new or badly stored in a garage.  This was horrible.I\\'m used to cast iron, for sure.  Been using good old American-made Lodge skillets for years, plus we regularly use a big cast iron wok imported from China.So, I\\'m giving only two stars because the pre-seasoning is a messy hassle.Now I\\'ve got to cook dinner. I bought this specifically for cooking eggs.  I\\'m not a cook and didn\\'t know what cast iron cooked like.  I hate cooking in it because the eggs stick like crazy. Wife informed me i\\'m an idiot and she bought me a nice teflon pan for my eggs! i love that thing.  THen the extra kick in the balls... I saw this at walmart for a dollar cheaper.If you know how to cook with this i\\'m sure it\\'s an ok pan.  I hate it and gave it away to someone. Too heavy. I used it under 10 times, and yet it was burned on the side, leaving a yellowish mark on the side. And again, TOO heavy. I own over a dozen Lodge Cast item pieces that I\\'ve happily used for many years and recently purchased this one to add to my collection.  Immediately, I noticed this pan seemed thinner and \"cheaper\" made, than in the past.  On the first use before heating, I noticed the pan bottom was warped upward in the center allowing oil and food to run to the edge.  After 3-4 uses, I noticed the bottom center seemed to be deteriorating.  After 5 uses, I noticed what seems to be a crack forming.  Now it will be thrown away.  I\\'ve NEVER had a problem with Lodge cast iron until now.  Very disappointed! The 3.5 inch seems to be the top diameter rather than the bottom diameter. It\\'s an amusing novelty, and I\\'ve toasted spices in it, but apart from gratuitous cuteness, or maybe creative serving ideas, there\\'s no reason to bother with a skillet this small. gave it away as a gift .May be beautifull to use the skillet on the outside Grill in your Garden . But inside the kitchen : no thanks.I am not living in stone age and kitchens filled with smoke .I returned imeadetely to my All Clad ,Calphalon non stick and Demeyere skillets enjoying the 21. Century technology. I love cast iron pans, but this one warped quickly with a high spot in the middle.  My 12&#34; is a Lodge skillet and I love it.  Pretty tough to cook with the warped one on an electric stove... When I opened the box, the first thing I saw was a big crack in the side. It looks like it might have cracked when it was being made, because the area around the crack was smoother and shinier than the rest of the skillet. Why would Lodge think Amazon would want a cracked skillet? Why would Amazon think I would want a cracked skillet? used once, wiped it out to use again. let it sit . well now its rusted and unable to use. waste of money This product is poorly manufactured.  The cooking surface has a \"rough\" texture which causes food to stick unnecessarily, whereas it should have been ground smooth before leaving the factory.  The handle had sharp edges which I needed to file down before using the pan.  The \"loop\" handle was a good idea, otherwise most folks would likely strain their wrists trying to lift this pan off the stove with one hand.  The construction is heavier and \"clunkier\" than it needs to be to perform its job properly.  Overall, this product is just plain lousy and cheap.  Anyone who says they\\'re satisfied with this item has never used a good quality iron fry pan.  Clearly, this product was manufactured for Wilma Flintstone. We wanted to move away from the nonstick skillets and their potential detrimental long term effects.  We had heard that the treated surface may have harmful substances.Well anyway.  We decided to got for an iron skillet like grandma used to use.  Yes we read the details on how to keep it properly seasoned.  And how to reseason.  How to slowly heat.  How to clean.I just have to admit I just can\\'t get the hang of using this thing.  Eggs and pancakes stick to it\\'s grainy surface.  They say not to scrub it but tiny foodstuff particles get struck in the sandy surface areas.  Whe you fry anything breaded, the breading sticks to the sandy surface (no matter how much butter you use).  And when I do give it a good scrubbing cause I can\\'t stand the idea of cooking while there\\'s old food bits still imbedded in the cooking surface,  then I must reseason it.Ok Ok bacon should be a safe bet. Right?  Whoa......it stuck to that like flypaper.  Ok Ok keep it dry so it doesn\\'t rust....Yea right.  It doesn\\'t look rusted until you look at it with a magnifying glass in direct sunlight.  It has a Martian landscape of micro-rust.I must admit we gave it a wholehearted attempt and really wanted to transition to iron, but it didn\\'t work out at all. As heavy as is pan is the bottom is too thin to evenly spread the heat to the edges unless you own a commercial kitchen stove like wolf or viking, I bought this pan to fry bacon with the pieces of raw bacon would cook in the middle but all the pieces 3 inches from the edge would not even begin to cook forcing me to move the pieces around which is more trouble than it\\'s worth.  Something I didn\\'t even think about was where to put the pan when not in use it is so large it took up one fourth of the entire space where I place all of my pots and pans. This is a big heavy skillet. Great size.I seasoned this Castiron skillet 4 times, at 400 degrees,for a hour each time.I still was not happy with it.Two times with bacon grease. Two times with organic Coconut oil.I guess I was expecting it to be like my old Griswold castiron.To me, it will never be like the old skillets.I saut&eacute;ed/fried sliced potatoes with coconut oil, and they stucked. I tried a egg, which wasa big mistake also.I find this pan very heavy compared to my old Castiron pans. Although with thehelper handle it did help. It is also a thicker castiron then the old skillets,which are not as heavy.Maybe I did something wrong, but the pan said it was pre-seasoned, and I seasoned it.The in side is very lumpy, and I could not get it smooth.. I did NOT wash it with soap.I really did not like this pan, and sent it back. I have a pretty nice gas stove. The problem is this thing is just too wide. There is a myth that cast iron is a great conductor. This is false (it is super dense and can absorb a ton of heat though, which is why it is good for searing and such). Even left on the cooktop for 15 minutes to try to heat evenly, the outside in about a 1 inch thick ring basically did not get hot at all. I tested this at first with my infrared themometer. I thought the readings were lying to me; so, I made some crepes in it. The results were unambiguous. The center was hot and the edge was cold, i.e. the crepe was brown in the center and raw on the outside.Now, I\\'ve used this for deep dish pizza. It works great for that. And I think it is cheaper than most pizza pans, so that\\'s not bad (though a pizza pan will likely have a straight side, and this is sloped slightly).If you have a super large cooking surface. For example a grill or an induction burner that covers the full stove surface, this would probably work well on that. Otherwise, it just isn\\'t going to be useful for you. I haven\\'t gotten the 12&#34; cast iron, but I think it would work for me, given the 1&#34; ring mentioned above. I thought I needed this. But it is way too heavy for what I thought it would be. That something was a frying pan whose middle would not bow up causing oil or butter to flow to the edges. I had been extraordinarily careful not to expose the pan to rapid temperature changes, yet the middle did bow up.I also thought that given enough mass in the bottom, heat distribution over an 8\" glass-top burner wouldn\\'t be an issue for cooking pancakes, etc. Not at all true. I still had about an 8\" heat island in my skillet. If I NEED or want even heat over more than an 8\" disk, I might have to acquire an electric griddle or skillet. I have moved on to cooking pancakes one-at-a-time and stir-frying using my non-stick wok.Cast iron holds a huge amount of heat and that has implications for your cooking. With this pan, I\\'d have to guess when to turn off the burner, because it would keep on cooking for a few minutes after. This led to more than a few dishes where my veggies would overcook. If you\\'re just cooking carrots or potatoes, no problem; broccoli lovers need to move to lighter cookware. Ultimately, this vessel was not a candidate for my style of cooking which needs responsive control of heat going to my food.Mine weighed 6 lb 11 oz. making for a challenge when cleaning. I have a sink whose finish I didn\\'t want chipped by my unintended dinging with the skillet. If you drop it on your foot, oh, that\\'ll hurt. Also if you think this would be a good weapon, maybe, though you might fall over when you take your back-swing. :) I enthusiastically ordered this skillet after reading all the positive reviews and looked forward to using it for a lifetime. Unfortunately, it arrived D.O.A. with about a 2 inch crack on the inside near where the pouring lip is. I thought to myself that maybe that is how they are manufactured but then noticed the crack ended with a chip on the top on the other side. I only then read other reviews mentioning these skillets arriving with cracks in them. I\\'m still in disbelief that a cast-iron skillet was damaged so drastically without even being used. The product is obviously flimsier than expectations and it\\'s caveat emptor with this one. Fortunately, I ordered from AMAZON (and not a third party), so returning an item is easy. I could not get this pan to stop from rusting&#8230;I actually bought two of these and had the same problem till I call it quits. Whatever this pan comes \"per-seasoned\" with, it does not keep me from having to violently scrape food off of it every time I cook. I even took the time to season it myself (5 cycles in the oven) and it has not made much of a difference. This is not a quality product. Don\\'t make the mistake i made and buy this cheap cast iron skillet.  The pan doesn\\'t heat consistently, the surface is uneven( meaning vegetable oil will go to one side, and everything sticks to it.  And to top that off it creates a hot spot right in the middle and the edges of the pan are cold.  You need to basically fill the pan up with enough oil so your frying your food.  I bought this pan because it was rated pretty good, but trust me this pan is garbage. I\\'ve used this skillet twice and I have to say I\\'m somewhat disappointed.  I love the cast iron aspects of it, but frankly the heat distribution of this pan is one of the worst I have seen in quite a while.  I get that, since it is such a large skillet and so much larger than the burner on the stovetop, some adjustment may be necessary.  However, the center heats up to the point of burning while the outside edges of the pan are too cool to cook in a decently short amount of time.I really wanted to like this pan but honestly...I\\'m thinking about returning it... I own a well seasoned steel Wok, 2 cast iron griddles and one small #3 Wagner cast iron skillet. I do not have to pamper these treasures. Just some coarse kosher salt and cold or hot water removes any oils or sticky sauces.The box that contained the Lodge skillet felt light. The factory packed inner box had a label that said 12.\" However, when I opened it my concern was realized. There was a 10\" pan inside. The replacement came quickly and I am supposed to get a credit for my shipping costs.I augmented the alleged \"pre-seasoned\" lodge skillet in the manner I was shown by a chef who was trained by the renowned French chef Escoffier.  The technique is simple. Moderate heat and Crisco solid shortening applied with bunched wax paper. The wax may even abet  the Crisco but the reason it is used is that no cellulose fibers will be incorporated into the shortening patina. Using a paper napkin or towel or cotton cloth will place fibers in the patina and they will create a place for food to adhere to.A teaspoon of Canola (Rapeseed) oil was put in the hot pan and then an egg followed. The egg stuck better than Crazy Glue and this did not surprise me, as I was suspicious of the pan when I saw it had a surface that looked like it had actually been cast in sand (which is still a way to cast iron.)My old, above mentioned, treasures all have surfaces as smooth as a baby\\'s bottom. They are a joy to work with. This pan is a joke. After the abyssmal performance I felt I had nothing to loose by messing with the surface so I tried to smooth out the pebbled (sand cast) surface but gave it up as I lack the proper materials to do so.Nonetheless, I think I may have abraded the so-called pre-seasoned surface enough to lay down my own patina that may smooth out with constant use. Otherwise, I will just use the skillet for frying things other than eggs or pancakes, etc. I saw a similar pan in large chain retailer for less money.A few days after posting my 1 star review I scrubbed the surface and seasoned the pan in a manner similar to that used by an earlier poster. I added Crisco and put in a hot oven. My wife got hot under her collar when the house was full of oily fumes.So I did not cure it for the full 40 minutes.I put the pan in my outdoors gas barbeque grill upside down and closed the cover. A hard patina formed. After a few times of gently warming on the gas stove using a diffuser I gave it a whirl with another egg. This time the pan was not very hot. After flipping the egg over on its yoke I was able to to slide it around like a hockey puck on ice. I had spread almost 1 teaspoon of Canola oil followed by a pat of butter.I am now a happy camper. I recommend this pan even though the cooking surface is not evenly flat and mine had a crease in it as well.I purchased my first Teflon pan in 1970 and it performed awesomely for almost 10 years. This was inexpensive and you could fry an egg without any oil. I gave it up after a good deal of the coating had peeled away. I have never seen a coated pan that performed as well as the first one I purchased. I am sure that companies stopped using that specific very smooth coating by 1980. I just tossed a coated Calphalon skillet that started to stick after 3 years of careful use. My wife would not let me use anything but a special plastic spatula or wooden spoon so it was not abused.Ken BatesBoston I am a Big Fan of Lodge Logic Cast Iron Pans so I was expecting this one to be just as good as the \"original\". I\\'m sorry to say that I was wrong. Immediately upon inspecting my brand new pre-seasoned pan, I noticed that flakes of the \"non-stick\" coating had scratched off during transit. I immediately sent it back to Amazon. I know it\\'s supposed to be convenient but if I were you, I would order the \"Lodge Original Finish 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet\". It\\'s not that hard to season it and it\\'s much, much better than the coating they use on their pre-seasoned pans. Also, a 12-inch is much more useful than the 10.5 inch pan. I\\'ve used this pan to make a single egg (the reason I wanted something this small) and even though it is \"preseasoned\" I\\'ve always pammed it and preheated it and the eggs still stick to the bottom. Because it cannot be soaked it is hard to scrub out the egg. It cooked a small piece of salmon well enough, but again it was hard to get clean. I bought the pan to make besan flour pancakes.  I used COCONUT OIL AND OLIVE OIL, but the pancakes STUCK to the pan.  WHY?  What am I doing wrong?I thought these pans were non-stick?BTW, eventhough my batter burned up in the pan, I cleaned up the pan in a snap!Took less than 1 minute to rinse with hot water.Also ... is it okay to use a stainless steel spatula?  It won\\'t scratch up the pan?Edit: (May 14, 2012)I pre-seasoned my pan, and made stir-fry today.YUMMY!!This is restaurant quality!LOVE this pan!Edit: November 25, 2012I\\'m leaving my ORIGINAL review in tact, so that people can see, I DID love this pan.7 months later, it RUSTED.  Yuck!This reviews goes from 5 stars to 1.  I\\'d give it NO stars, if I could.Frankly, I don\\'t think it\\'s healthy cooking food in RUST.Nasty.This is not like the old-fashioned cast iron pan my mother used.  Hers didn\\'t rust. And we were rough on it.Edit:Oh Geez!  There are just too many \"do\\'s n\\' Don\\'ts\" with this pan.Don\\'t leave a lid/cover on it.Be sure it is completely dry.It if gets RUSTY, sand it down and pre-season AGAIN.Blah, blah, blah.Too much to know.  It\\'s just a pan, for pete\\'s sake. After 3 months of light use, some kind of flaw in the bottom of the pan exploded while it was on an electric burner.  The little explosion blew an eighth-inch deep divot out of the bottom of the pan, which was powerful enough to also damage the electric heating element.If it had happened in the top surface of the pan instead of the bottom, the user could have been seriously harmed.I have several Lodge pans that are 30 or more years old, and this is the first time I have ever experienced this.Has Lodge reduced its quality control lately ?I will not replace the damaged pan with another Lodge product.  I am going to eBay to buy an antique for 3 times the price.I guess the only way I can get quality now is from the past. As the title says, maybe I\\'m just doing something wrong, but I can\\'t seem to get this thing properly seasoned.  Whatever I try and cook in this sticks like crazy, and it\\'s just an all around pain compared to my other pans.  In theory I love this skillet, but in practice I almost never even try to use it anymore. I love the concept but it just didnt work for me.Everything sticks, even after I seasoned it, put in oven, cool it down reseason it, over 3 times ... It still stick.My mistake was also that I used it to make acidic food (like tomato sauce), I had no idea and the dish came out tasting odd.I guess this pan is just good to sautee some chicken with onions or to make a steak aybe? I really dont know but it doesnt help my cooking style :( too bad. i can\\'t wash it in the dishwasher. it rusts if left wet or unused.. to much work for me. i threw it out once it rusted. too bad. Mine gets rusty when wet.  I need to dry it with a towel right after use to keep it from rusting.  Maybe it is my well water (but it is softened and treated with an acid neutralizer and I tested the pH with a pool test strip and it seems to be fine???) but it\\'s weird.  Not sure I trust my tetanus shot enough to keep using this thing.  Super heavy too. for some reason i thought this had a 3,5 in radius ,..  its tiny about hald the size of my smallest isle. I have no idea of what to do with this tiny skillet.  its not even worth throwing at someone as a weapon. lolit is like the other pans and skillets but its tiny. if you are looking for that it would be great for you, I have read a number of positive reviews and decided to buy this pan (the first cast-iron pan i my life). Unfortunately, I was not lucky with my purchase. Even with a good care of the pan (I followed the instructions of care), it got rust after being used for a week. I have never used soap or a dishwasher! It is really hard to clean because food stick to it. I am very unhappy with this product. Every time I cook on it meal has some \"metallic\" taste and smell. I tried to recast this skillet, it didn\\'t help. Tried to recast again - same result. Stay away from this skillet !!! I ordered this item from Amazon.com in the expectation that it would arrive promptly and in good shape. It did come as quickly as I could have hoped but it was shoddily packed and the shipping container, flimsy cardboard, had obviously endured great abuse somewhere on its journey. When I opened the box I found that the skillet was loosely padded with two small wads of what looked like butcher-shop paper and the small handle had broken off the skillet in transit (I suppose). Since this is quite a heavy item, weighing about thirteen pounds, it needs two hands to lift it on and off the stove: without the small handle, that was impossible.I had no choice but to return it, both pieces, with regret. I remonstrated with Amazon about their poor packaging and was simply told that they were grateful for my feedback. My two star rating is not about the skillet, which I never used, but about Amazon\\'s inferior shipping container that could not protect even a piece of cast iron from terminal damage.Lodge Logic L14SK3 15-Inch Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet Firstly it was my bad not to look at the introduction carefully so that I was a little shocked by how heavy this cast iron skillet is. Well, that was OK. I thought I could still deal with it and use it.But It\\'s just not non-stick. I used it to fry two eggs, the egg white got on the bottom and couldn\\'t be washed off ever since. I thought it was my way of using, but when I looked back at the instruction, again, I found my way of using was OK. Oil first, heat it, then food in.I\\'m very disappointed. This is a great skillet, especially for the price.  It is not too heavy and it is a nice size for a single person or couple, but probably not ideal for a larger family.  I seasoned the skillet a couple times myself with olive oil at 500 F for an hour and have had great performance so far.  It is my first cast iron pan, so I did my research... DO NOT USE SOAP!  Only hot water and maybe salt if you need an abrasive.  After using it, I think everyone should have a good old handy cast iron skillet in their kitchen.***UPDATE***So... a couple years later and this skillet has not held up.  The fake \"seasoning\" is peeling and weird and is now unsuitable for cooking.  Maybe I can scrap it all off and re-season the cast iron.  Unfortunate, since it was a good price.  Changed the rating from 5 to 2 stars. The pre-seasoning is presumably intended to counter the fact that the inside surface is left unsmoothed, perhaps to reduce production costs. However, on the unsmooth surface, pre-seasoning did not reduce sticking. I finally polished the inner surface with abrasives and now the pan matches traditional expectations for this wonderful class of cookware. Lodge had a very good name in the industry for a long time. They have ruined their reputation. I seriously regret this purchase. Very substandard quality. I can only guess that the company was purchased by an investment house and lowered their quality in the name of Investor dividends or the executives wanted a larger salary and decided to trade quality for bonus money. I buy American whenever I can find it since I am done with poorly made Chinese imports. I had expected a certain amount of pride and quality in an American made product but it simply is not there with this product. If you really want to buy their product, don\\'t even bother with their directions, just assume that this is not yet a completed product and finish it yourself. You will need to sand the inside of the pan to obtain a smooth finish and then season the pan using normal seasoning methods. As long as the bumpy and pitted cooking surface and the &#34;pre-seasoning&#34; on the cooking surface remains, you will find yourself in an endless and frustrating cycle of cleaning and re-seasoning just to make it barely useable. Unfortunately, I only read the good reviews before purchasing and now after reading the one star reviews I find myself experiencing the same nightmare that so many others have experienced. Shame on Lodge, there is no excuse for this substandard product. I have used Iron skillets for decades and do not speak from ignorance. It was ok at first, though it was a little bit small.It started to rust on the inside some time ago, which I don\\'t like at all.  It\\'s about 2 years old, but it\\'s been rusting a little at a time for a while.I plan to buy a stainless steel skillet to replace it the next chance I get. I bought this hoping to get it well seasoned so that I could use it without non stick spray or oil.  Even after using it repeatedly, it never got seasoned enough, and it also started to develop rust spots.  Maybe I was doing something wrong with the care, but I was disappointed, and I ended up giving it away. I love the idea of cast iron skillets, especially when I see them used in cookbooks, but maybe it\\'s because I\\'m not Southern, but I can\\'t seem to maintain a cast iron skillet, pre-seasoned or not. You have to keep it oiled often and even the tiniest drop of water will cause rust. Once something rusts, I get way too nervous to even consider using it. If you are up for the challenge of maintaining, I think it looks very nice and heats well, especially on a bbq or gas flame. After one time use, although i coated with oil..it burned on the surface of the pan and I can\\'t get off  the food that sticks to the pan. I poured the water for a couple of hours to clean.. and it rusted and I smelled iron. I can\\'t still clean off the surface.. it doesn\\'t come off ever. My money is gone ~! I got this because I need more iron, and I eat a lot of eggs. I found the surface too rough to cook eggs and get them out of the pan. You would  have to float them on butter or oil to get them out of this pan. Back to my non stick pan...I would take it camping, if I ever went camping.'"

and other fattier cuts of meat, create a LOT of smoke when cooked indoors on this baby, even with a window cracked and the exhaust fan on (I cooked a ribeye a while back that left my apartment smelling like a bbq pit for like 3 days, it was worth it though).Cleaning it is easy.\\nI just get it hot (either by cleaning soon after using it or heating it up in the oven before cleaning) and scrub with some kosher salt and a paper towel, rinsing it out afterwards (and immediately wiping it off, I don\\'t leave it to dry as it could rust).In short - this thing is great, and well worth the price.\\nWorks great on my induction stove, heats up fast and the food tastes wonderful.\\nI use this skillet all the time cooking steaks and when i fry anything.\\nYou really can\\'t go wrong with Lodge Logic; it is seen as the top cast iron for a reason.\\nI would also recommend the griddle...it\\'s great.If you are going between the 10 and 12 inch pan...get the 12 there\\'s more room for a full steak.\\nI like all my cast iron.\\nMy mother and mother-in-law both cook with skillets that have been well seasoned, and I\\'m very happy to achieve the same with mine.\\nI love using my Cast Iron skillets just love them.\\nWhen properly cared for (meaning by seasoning it once in awhile and not abrasively scrubbing and washing this pan with soap water) this pan will be the best non-stick pan you can find!As a professional cook, when I cook at home I use this pan regularly.\\nFrom deep frying (nice heavy pan holds heat well), pan searing then putting the whole pan into the oven to roast and finish, to even baking!Do not use this for braising or say...\\nLodge has been making cast-iron for a long time and they make great products.\\nThis is my first experience cooking with cast iron.\\nEven though the instructions said to expect eggs to stick the first few uses, I did not have a problem.\\nI did let the pan heat up, sprayed it with PAM, fried my eggs and they slid off like from Teflon.\\nI will be buying more cast iron pans in the future.\\nIf you\\'re looking for a cast iron skillet this is the one you should buy.\\nThe price is fantastic and the skillet is a great size.This is a necessity for any home chef.\\nThe explosive flavor that this thing produces due all the yummy fats and sauces that have seeped into it are the best part, though.There are a few downsides of course: 1) It\\'s heavy as hell, 2) the handle gets too hot to hold without a mitten, 3) it takes a little bit longer to heat up than standard skillets that are thinner, 4) it\\'s kind of easy to burn your fingers on the edges of the skillet when you go to stir the food, and 5) I hear that you can ruin the skillet if you use soap to clean it.\\nWe got this as a gift from our wedding registry.It\\'s solid, heavy, and it\\'s already taken a great deal of cooking, including stovetop to oven.We were so pleased with the way it cooked, we bought another as a gift to a friend.So far, no cracks, no breaks, no scratches, no defects.\\nI never cooked with cast iron so I can\\'t explain why, but I prefer using this lodge logic to my other nice cookware.My wife has made sure that I keep and clean it correctly when I use it, so it\\'s in perfect shape and cooks beautifully.\\nI had an ancient 8 inch cast iron skillet that has been in my family forever and it\\'s getting very pitted and food is sticking more and more.\\nIt actually rusted a bit when we cleaned it after first use; so we did indeed still have to season it ourselves, but after that it\\'s been a trooper.\\n(If you\\'re worried about the rusting, don\\'t be; that\\'s a side effect of cleaning a not-well-seasoned pan too aggressively and it\\'s easily fixed.\\nFor years and years, I avoided buying a cast iron skillet.\\nI\\'d never cooked with one and found the idea of using something not coated in teflon pretty intimidating.Then, I got this Lodge cast iron skillet.\\nBefore using it, I read several articles online about properly seasoning, cooking with, and cleaning cast iron and followed these directions to the letter.\\nI rubbed on some bacon grease, popped the skillet into the oven, heated it for a while, took it out, let it cool, then repeated.\\nAs the skillet becomes more seasoned over time, it smokes less.To clean my cast iron skillet, I pour avocado oil into it while it\\'s still warm and dump in some coarse sea salt.\\nI use a clean, lint-free cloth to scrub the oil and salt into the skillet, removing any cooked on food.\\nThen, I give it a good rinse in hot water and place the skillet into a hot oven until it is dry (quickly drying with heat avoids a build up of rust).\\nOnce the skillet is dry, I pour in just a bit of oil and spread it around before storing the pan until the next use.With good care and a bit of effort, cast iron is a kitchen essential.\\nI wish I\\'d gotten a good cast iron skillet years ago, but I do enjoy making up for lost time!\\nThis skillet is very heavy; the extra handle is there because you really do need to use it.\\nRegardless, this is a great cast iron piece to start with and you can\\'t beat the price!\\nThey are heavy to handle but if you are buying a cast iron skillet, you know that anyway.\\nIf you carefully examine most cast iron cookware, you will see some imperfections.The first three times I used my skillet, I re-seasoned it at 450 degrees.\\nThe pre-seasoning done by Lodge is good for a foundation, but you should expect to improve upon it.\\nI do not use soap (although the Lodge website says that a small amount won\\'t hurt it) because my grandmother would roll over in her grave, if I did it.\\nI then use a Lodge scraper (bought from Amazon: Lodge SCRAPERPK Durable Polycarbonate Pan Scrapers, Red and Black, 2-Pack) and scrape off any remaining food.\\nI dry the skillet immediately and while it is still warm, spread extra virgin light olive oil on the pan (inside and out).\\nI use my hands and not a paper towel to avoid leaving lint on the pan.\\nAfter sliding a sheet of aluminum foil on the oven shelf on the bottom, I slip my skillet into the pre-heated over on the middle shelf and set the timer for an hour.\\nAfter an hour, I cut off the heat and let the oven (and the skillet) return to room temperature (don\\'t open the oven door, as the slower the heat drop, the better).\\nEvery third or fourth time I use it, I re-season it at a lower temperature (say 350 degrees).\\nMy grandmother got to a point when she only seasoned her pans two or three times per year.Also, I would prefer to use flax seed oil in the seasoning process, but, if you do your research, there are all sorts of debates on what type oil to use.\\nAs a lover of cast iron this was a great piece.\\nI purchased it so as to use it in my toaster oven and it works great for that purpose.\\nAfter a second try at a lower heat level, I could actually watch the eggs lift from the pan when they were ready to be flipped.\\nLodge Logic also makes a pan called the one egg wonder...\\nOne piece of bread fits perfectly so grilled cheeses, toasted sandwiches and the like are great here too, among other things.It fit the small burner on my electric stove perfectly.\\nIt covers all of the coils so no uncovered heat and all the dangers that that implies.If you\\'re new to cast iron, as I am, make sure to use something when touching the handle.\\nI use them all the time to heat up left overs, make pies, bake bread, cook eggs, fry bacon, and anything else that fits into it.\\nI burned the first thing I tried to cook by using too high of a heat and not seasoning it first.\\nAfter washing, I put it on a medium heat, coat it lightly with oil using a paper towel, let it heat for a few minutes, then wipe it clean and cool it down before storing it again.\\nWhen I have used the procedure that Lodge recommends, my cast iron has become gummy.\\n7 years later, I\\'m still using this same skillet; it has been reseasoned once or twice (to get progressively better seasoning), and is still going strong.A tip: the best seasoning process I\\'ve found to give a hard, slick surface is 5+ very thin coats of flax seed oil, wiping it off after apply the oil and before baking.\\nWell, we\\'ve been replacing all of our teflon and figured to give a cast iron skillet a try...LOVE it!\\nBest cast iron ever and with Amazon\\'s price...even better!\\nIt never seasoned, was hard to clean and had hot spots all throughout that made cooking a chore.\\nThis pan has virtually no hot spots, seasons well, as a result cleans like a dream.\\nIt\\'s not the easiest to clean, since you can\\'t just throw it in the dish washer, but that\\'s with any cast iron skillet.\\nBought this and the 8 inch skillet because I want to get away from teflon.\\nSome things don\\'t seem to cook as well in cast-iron but for the most part they\\'re both great.\\nThis pan comes pre-seasoned, but it needs additional seasoning to become more non-stick.\\nOverall, I\\'m enjoying cooking with cast iron and this skillet seems perfect.\\nLove: after seasoned, I could cook anything in it without sticking!\\nI know it\\'s cast iron, I know, I know.....It makes stove top to oven cooking method quite challenging.\\nI am sure we will make good use out of this purchase for a long, long time.\\nWas looking at bacon presses for more money and saw a review saying they bought a press and ended up using a small cast iron pan instead.\\nWent to visit my daughter and noticed she only cooks in cast iron so I decided to give it a try.\\nI soak my pan in warm to hot water and use a soft to medium bristle brush to get food off.\\nI never leave it wet- I dry it off by putting on gas stove and add some oil so its ready for my next use.\\nBefore I start cooking, I let it get warm on low (so heat distributes evenly) till I see a little bit of smoke starting to rise- seems to help in avoiding the food from sticking.\\nI had always used \"non-stick\" pans and have gotten tired of the non-stick going away after a few uses.\\nThis came pre-seasoned like the description says, but I also added some olive oil to the pan.\\nI did get a little sticking of the eggs on the grooves of the pan, but I chalk that up to me not getting the utinsil in there to move it around.\\nAs the 952nd person to review this, I would say that this is a quality product worth purchasing.Recipe:1/2 lb bacon cut up1/2 lb hot links cut up1/4 lb turkey or ham deli meat cut up1/4 onion cut up16 large eggsSecret ingredient: Tapatio hot sauceKraft Mexican style cheeseHeat skillet on just above med heat.\\nWhen all the meat is fully cooked to your preference (everyone likes their bacon at a different crunch level), add the eggs to the skillet.\\nI have a small gas grill, and this little frying pan has become my favorite and most useful grilling accessory.\\nMake sure the skillet is seasoned inside and out, so if the meat bumps into the skillet it won\\'t stick.\\nThey make all kinds of gadgets to grill veggies and other small stuff on the grill, but a plain old cast iron pan does just fine.\\nI have to guess that cast iron is one of those things that, either you grow up with it and you are used to it, or no one in your family has ever owned one and you just don\\'t get why anyone would want one of these pans.\\nWell, for all of my adult life, I had lived with cheap non-stick pans and when my last set went, my husband went and got me a Rachel Ray set for much more than I had ever spent.\\nI decided that I wasn\\'t going to keep eating my pots, so wanted something without a non-stick coating, and I\\'m too bad a cook to go for a plain metal pot, because I had visions of all of the scrubbing I would have to do to get off burnt food.\\nI looked at the cast iron, and decided that the price wasn\\'t bad, and if I hated cooking on it, it is heavy enough to make a good weapon if anyone breaks into my house.\\nFor the record, they state that you should use some oil the first few times you cook so it doesn\\'t stick, and I did find that to be helpful, but even when my eggs stuck a little, it was easy enough to scrape right off.\\nI must say this cast iron skillet is quickly becoming my favorite to cook in after only one week.\\nReceived this skillet and discovered it had scratches in the bottom of it which marred the pre-seasoning.\\nThe handle is so short that it is always overheating.I own 2 other Farberware larger pre-seasoned cast iron skillets and they arrived in perfect condition.\\nThey also have longer handles which are more ergonomically designed so they are easier to use and never overheat.I love cast iron since it is so durable but it would have been too expensive to ship the Lodge skillet back for a replacement so I kept it the way it was.\\nI will have to do the seasoning myself on it.I personally think that Farberware makes a better, more user friendly product and would recommend their cast iron products over Lodge.\\nOnce you cooked on cast iron, you will never want to use anything else.\\nAgain the item is terrific, no more frying potatoes in the skillet first to season it, it works great but very, very small.\\nOne of my heavy-duty non-stick aluminum pans started flaking off, and I needed replacement.\\nNow that I know, I will look for something cast iron to do my roasts...\\nTo visualize this item, think of the handle as having the dimensions of a popsicle stick, with the rest being comparable in size to a manhole cover.\\nThe price I got from Amazon, $29.99 plus free shipping, is by the pound about 4 times higher than the world market price for bulk scrap iron, but on the other hand this merchandise is delivered to one\\'s doorstep in the shape of a useful finished cooking utensil, with an excellent preseasoned treatment.\\nThrow two pounds of mussels into it, right out of the box, or a big steak, or a pan pizza.\\nOh but my cornbread sure taste good when baked in my iron skillet.\\nI already own a cast iron skillet with ridges and use it often for \"grilling\" steaks and fish when I want grill marks.\\nThis skillet seemed like the best option because it has a large cooking surface, it came preseasoned, and because I think that Lodge Logic is a good brand (I own their hibachi grill which works very well).When I use the skillet nothing sticks to it and cleaning is easy.\\nI use a silicone pan handle sleeve and the handle seems short and a little tricky to grab inside the sleeve.Overall, I am glad I purchased this pan.\\nThe size is good for bulk cooking such as 4 servings worth of food.\\nNothing that two hands can\\'t handle though.Below is contains some of the same info as the 6\" skillet review and basically sings accolades about cast iron and Lodge Logic in general.I love cooking with cast iron because it heats evenly.\\nAfter doing extensive research on the best cookware that doesn\\'t leech harmful chemicals, I choose to cook with cast iron.\\nLodge Logic hasn\\'t failed me; I own the 6 inch version of this skillet and a dutch oven.\\nI don\\'t even want to try other cast iron products.Cleaning is a breeze as it is virtually non-stick (without those synthetic chemicals).\\nI can\\'t speak for its oil-free non-stick quality because I love to use olive oil and butter in my cooking (I\\'m a healthy, organic eater and my research says those items are good for you, especially if you use raw butter).\\nThis a great size pan for me and my family.\\nAll the cast iron I own is Lodge Logic and it holds up forever.\\nI called Lodge and verified that the combo package with the glass lid contains L10SK3 skillet.\\nWhen I was growing up, my mother had a ten inch cast iron skillet in which she cooked almost everything.\\nIf it could be cooked, it could be cooked in her cast iron skillet.That skillet now resides in my kitchen, and it is still used for almost everything, even though my style of cooking has changed a bit from what I learned from my mother.\\nBetween a cast iron dutch oven (also from my mother\\'s kitchen) and this skillet, for every day cooking, I have almost all I need (my other \\'necessary\\' is a good coffee maker, but that\\'s another story.) I suppose I should mention here that I am well over my second 20th birthday.\\nBoth the the skillet and dutch oven have been in use for at least half a century.\\nI\\'m not sure how long the well-seasoned skillet was in use before it came to my mother.\\nI\\'ve had it for a while now, and it\\'s just starting to acquire that wonderful, smooth black surface that all cast iron gets, if used and cared for correctly.\\nI\\'ve had no problems at all with it.I know there are proponents of cast iron cookware and there are those who don\\'t understand what all the hoopla is about.\\nI have an aunt who will not cook in anything but good stainless steel and who looks down her nose at anything cast iron.\\nDifferent schools of cooking have different tastes and that\\'s fine.If you\\'ve ever really used good cast iron cookware, however, you will appreciate this skillet.\\nThrow out all pre-conceived notions of how cooking &#34;should&#34; be done, and you might come to believe that almost everything, from soup to desserts, tastes better when cooked in cast iron.\\nI would recommend a good skillet for any newcomer to start with, though maybe not this large.For those who are newcomers, let me say this: Good seasoning is an absolute requirement for ALL cast iron cookware.\\nI would recommend seasoning the pot or pan or skillet at least twice - three times is better - before you use it.\\nTo loosen stuck particles, heat the pan, dump in hot water, and let it boil for a few minutes.\\nWipe dry completely, and oil liberally while the pan still retains some heat.\\nIf rust spots should ever develop (which should not happen if the pan is cared for correctly), scour the spots with steel wool until completely gone and then re-season the pan as if it was brand new.\\nAll cast iron under ten years old should be re-seasoned every few months.Too much to do just to have a skillet or pan to use?\\nMost people, I suppose, simply don\\'t want to bother with the care needed for cast iron to become an actual heirloom.\\nThis is a really fun little pan to use.\\nI used it right out of the box to fry an egg and didn\\'t have any problems with the egg sticking to the pan.My only gripe is that they don\\'t make a tiny little lid for this pan!\\nIt makes the best baked chicken then fries eggs in the morning that do not stick.\\nWe love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff - we love nothing more than our cast iron and Lodge makes great ones at decent prices.\\nIt\\'s so healthy too!Just make sure you season it a couple times before first use for nonstick to work better.I love them so much that started my cast iron collection and got rid of all my teflon pots and pan.I highly recommend buying this and other cast iron products, especially made by Lodge- Made in the USA!\\nWe had one at a restaurant and they used a small cast iron skillet.\\nThe Lodge skillet is the gold standard in modern cast iron skillets.\\nI will say that I put a lot of work into seasoning it with bacon grease initially, and the skillet has never seen a drop of soap.\\nDespite these traits, it\\'s still not as good as an antique Griswold skillet from the 1940s, because the

the skillet was cast.\\nI cooked two bone-in rib eye steaks with this skillet and it tasted way better than when I ate at a fine dining steak houses.\\nThis skillet cooks the steak evenly throughout

yourself.\\nYou will get a much better season.Wash with hot water and a scrubber or with hot oil and salt.\\nIf you are not careful your non-stick seasoning can get removed and you will end up with a

couple uses, the pan was non-stick enough to make pancakes without butter in the pan.\\nbacon and eggs cleaned up well, but the chicken got kind of cripsed on, so I had to use a scrub pad, which removed some of the season...be careful!\\nGrowing up in the south I learned quick that cornbread that is actually worth eating must be made with a few simple ingredients:  cornmeal, buttermilk,

often.\\nI bought a few different sizes all at once I do think this one seems the nicest not only in terms of weight and usability but I also feel the pre-season was the best.\\nI love cooking with

could overcome the size and mass of this thing by preheating it and working with awareness of the thermodynamic problems it presents, but I have not had practical success so far.My reference pan is a well seasoned All Clad Cop-R-Chef 12\" fry pan.\\nCast iron is much better than stainless for fried eggs, and this spacious 15\" pan would provide considerably more room for frying and could saute

skillet in the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes.Chicken breasts are done the same way, except they\\'ll take about 10 minutes in the oven.\\nBut don\\'t expect it to be just like a non-stick skillet or you\\'ll be disappointed - it does take some care and some breaking-in.Even though it\\'s pre-seasoned, I seasoned it further by heating oil in it to smoking a couple of times, and I still use a tiny bit of oil when I cook in it.\\nAnd unlike non-stick pans, it\\'s iron and will rust, so after washing (water only, no soap) I dry it well and wipe it with a little Crisco.\\nEvery once in a while something sticks but a quick scrub with a scrubber sponge takes care of it.The surface is a little more pebbly than my 40-yr old, 12\" cast-iron skillet (which has a mirror-like finish and nothing ever sticks to it) so eggs were a bit of a challenge at first, but after using it for 6 months they rarely stick; over time as I cook with it, it gets better and better.\\nthis one, too, will

said in these here parts :-) This is a great skillet, but is very very larger....I don\\'t think a normal stove burner can handle this big boy!\\nEvery serious cook needs a 12\\' cast iron skillet.\\nProperly seasoned, it is totally non-stick, cleaning up with a casual flick of a paper towel.\\nI have been known to over use the \"high heat\" setting, and happens that from time to time, billows of smoke emerge from my kitchen.\\nIf that\\'s from a cast iron pan, it\\'s merely a ruined meal.\\nIt works equally well on gas, charcoal, wood fires and electric stoves, so it\\'s a camping essential.It\\'s rim is high enough to use as a saucepan - and that\\'s where the term \"pan gravy\" comes from.\\nControllable, even heat is the secret to good gravy - and of course, meat juices.It\\'s equally at home in the oven as on the stove - unlike many composite-handled stainless steel skillets.\\nThe crust of a pie baked in cast iron is equal to or superior to Pyrex.A twelve-inch steak and whatever pie, four inches deep will feed six to eight people easily.It will also fry six eggs at a time; doing duty as a griddle.All told, this skillet is one of the most generally useful items in the kitchen.\\nI have coated and baked the pan alone several times and I know I have to be patient to get a real non stick surface.\\nI bought this pan in a store for twice what it cost on Amazon, but it\\'s such a great product I have no regrets.This is superb for searing meat and stir fries and so on, and the non-stick capacity improves with each use (with none of the adverse health issues assoicated with modern non-stick surfaces that are so easy to damage).Cleanup on this product is a breeze.\\nAfter use just wash with a brush, don\\'t use soap, dry, and either heat it on the burner to get rid of any remaining water on the surface (which is what I do) or spray it with a cooking spray such as Pam (or lightly rub it with cooking oil and a paper towel [I don\\'t do it this way because it seems unnecesary, but it\\'s what\\'s recommended, perhaps in more humid climates like at the ocean than the one I live in]).It\\'s very nice that you can buy a Cook\\'s Illustrated top performer at such a very reasonable price.\\nCooks three eggs every morning so perfectly your household will queue up to use it.\\nWell, I started to panic that the inner dimension is only 10 inches and not the 12 I felt I was replacing.Great news:  when I just ten minutes ago received the pan I put it on my stove and laid my Farberware \"12\" inch skillet inside.\\nI NOW have 12 inch skillet with a slightly larger than 10 inch cooking surface which is about an inch bigger than what I thought I had in the Farberware piece.I am soooo glad I didn\\'t order the 15 inch Lodge skillet or I would actually have a pan that I could not fit on my glass cooktop and would not have been able to use, not to mention the extra four pounds for the bigger pan and an additional $15 pricetag.LESSON:  Measure your pan.\\nYou might not be so lucky if you don\\'t measure first.The 12 inch Lodge pan has a 10 inch cooking surface.\\nIt is 12 inches on the outside from lip to lip.Please be careful because with cast iron you do need EXACTLY the right size for your glass stovetop as you can\\'t have an overhang of more than one inch or the stovetop can break as per manufacturers instructions.UPDATE:  I have had this pan for a little over 4 years now.\\nThis is the pan I use about 95% of the time.\\nAbout a year ago I was getting frustrated because all the non-stick abilities were gone and I was getting little black pieces of \"seasoning\" in all my foods.\\nI quickly realized that by washing it with a scrub sponge and soap was erradicating my pan of its seasoning.\\nIn addition, the inside of the pan was looking like it was starting to rust.\\nI gave it a quick and thorough cleaning to get all the loose seasoning off and I have since been using only a soft sponge with little soap, and after that, heating up the pan for a minute (at most) with a little olive oil coating the pan.\\nOnce it heats up, I turn off the burner and take a paper towel and wipe up any extra oil that might be in the pan.\\nI once again have a beautiful non-stick pan that I love so much.\\nFor anything that needs to be steamed, I simply add liquid, put the cast iron lid that I bought separately on top and veggies steam right in the pan.I really can\\'t say enough good things about cast iron cookware.\\nJust read online about how to use a cast iron skillet.\\nI saw this pan at the outlet store in Wrenthem MA for $80 and thought that was a good deal....i got this as a gold box discount for under $40.\\nThe pan is outstanding and cooks like a cast-iron skillet should...highly recommend this over paying a lot of money for a name brand skillet.\\nI love to cook steak in a cast iron skillet.\\nIf you\\'re only looking for one cast iron pan, a 10\" is the way to go.As far as quality goes, there is no question.\\nWhile I spent endless hours researching the relative merits of hard-anodized and stainless steel-clad cookware, I decided to pick this skillet up in the meantime because it looked A) inexpensive, B) easy to use, and C) pretty darn near indestructible.Three months later, we rarely use anything else!It works equally well for melting cheese on nachos or baking bread in the oven as it does for stir-frying vegetables and cooking omelets on the range.\\nThe pre-seasoning process really works, and if the skillet is cared for properly (gentle handwashing, avoiding too high heat, always stored dry), the nonstick properties of the cooking surface only improve with time.\\nDo note that cast iron probably isn\\'t for you if you just want to throw it in the sink overnight after use - it\\'ll be a rusty mess the next day, and while this is fairly easy to correct with steel wool and a little effort, cast iron really shouldn\\'t be treated this way.Cast iron is safe for use on a glass-top range; some range manufacturers recommend against it, but if you\\'re careful not to drop or drag the skillet on the surface, it won\\'t cause any damage (see comments).\\nIf you\\'re still concerned about scratching, check out enameled cast iron:Lodge Enameled Cast-Iron 11-Inch Skillet, Cafe Brown THIS SKILLET CAME PRE-SEASONED AND READY TO GO WITH WONDERFUL INSTRUCTIONS.\\nI would recommend this pre seasoned skillet to anyone looking for a really nice fry pan.\\nMay need a couple of uses before it is truly seasoned.\\nThis skillet is an amazing value for such a high quality and useful tool.Literally every piece of meat that I cook is now cooked in this pan.\\nChicken, steak, burgers, fish (seared tuna is amazing on from this skillet), you name it.Cleaning cast iron after cooking is 5x easier than stainless steel.\\nWhen I\\'m done, I just scrape it with a metal pan scraper (also sold on Amazon) to get the big debris off (be careful not to scratch the skillet with the corners of the scraper).\\nIt\\'s so easy!Cleaning it like this leaves enough of the oils behind to keep the skillet seasoned, and makes it so every meal that you cook tastes better than your last.I love my cast iron skillet.\\nI have wanted a smaller size cast iron frying pan and am so glad I sent for this one.\\nI don\\'t know how or when we would ever use this size pan.\\nOne of my favorites This was the first Lodge pan I bought and I am now completely sold on cast iron.\\nIn fact, I have replaced all of my non-stick cookware with old-fashioned Lodge products because of their even cooking capabilities, ease of cleaning and the ability to use them outdoors on an open fire or grill...\\nIt was so convenient having it pre-seasoned and with such a great quality for the price, I wouldnt buy from another brand :) Definitely recommend this skillet!\\nMy husband and I got our first cast iron pan about a year ago.\\nWe\\'ve been learning to cook more lately and needed a cast iron skillet for some of our recipes.\\nWe\\'ve used it about five times now, cleaning it right away and we\\'re happy to report that it\\'s in perfect condition.\\nNow I\\'ve cooked with cast iron a long time, and one thing I have discovered is that it is best to have a pan for cooking strong tasting meats like fish or cajun dishes.\\nI use this pan for pretty much all other meats, and it works extremely well.The one extremely important property that needs to be added is simply the fact that you will want a metal spatula to go with your cast iron cookware.\\nUsually, a small scraping action is enough to separate the food from the skillet, but a plastic spatula just won\\'t cut it in that regard.\\nAlso, a plastic spatula will likely melt given how well cast iron retains heat.\\nI love iron skillets, I\\'ve used them during the college years.\\nAs a student I couldn\\'t afford the high end pans, so I went with the next best thing, iron.\\nI still use these, makes me feel like a man in the kitchen, ha-ha.MADE IN THE USA I purchased this skillet and absolutely love it.\\nThis thing feels like it will last forever and a little extra TLC will keep happy.Absolutely recommend.\\nPros:Heavy iron that distributes and maintains heat well.Excellent size that will fit up to 4 burgers simultaneously.Excellent price for a made-in-america product.Come preseasoned, but I still applied 6 coats of flax seed oil, baking it in the oven for 30 minutes between applications.Better than every teflon pan I\\'ve ever used.Best cooking utensil I\\'ve ever owned because the browning is incomparable to other pans I\\'ve owned.\\nThis is the only thing to use for making home fries.It can also be used as a dutch oven if you buy the lid.Also great for camping or defending yourself.Cons:Not for weak wrists and may require two hands to move it off the stove.Doesn\\'t work in the microwave.\\nAfter years of cooking and buying and replacing non-stick cookware, I decided I\\'d try a return to cast iron.\\nI had previously purchased a Dutch Oven and I was happy with the results and decided I could no longer do without a cast iron skillet.\\nI love cooking in it and can do a steak in the oven that is as good as any that comes off the grill.\\nI took one star off as I don\\'t find the seasoning that comes on the Lodge products to stand up well.\\nIt\\'s no real problems for me as I actually enjoy seasoning my cast iron myself and it just involved an extra step of stripping off the pre-seasoning which was easily accomplished.\\nIt cooks so evenly and food doesn\\'t burn like in other light-weight frying pans.\\nIf you don\\'t like heavy frying pans, this is not for you.\\nNice big 12\" skillet, no flaws in the casting, factory seasoning not that great.\\nCooked some bacon first, it did stick a little in a dry skillet but no big deal to get it loose.\\nCleaned the skillet with hot water and a stiff brush; no soap although I do use a small amount from time to time.\\nThrew the frozen burgers 2 at a time on a 500 degree pre heated skillet (infrared thermometer is awesome) with no sticking problems.\\nBurgers turned out great.I have since added several layers carbon and the seasoning is pretty good to go at this point.\\nI seasoned by cleaning it with a small amount of dish washing soap and hot water.\\nAfter it\\'s bone dry I add as thin a layer of soybean oil as possible over mostly just the cooking surface.\\nNote properly well seasoned cast iron will look a little glossy too.\\nIf it looks kind of oily and not too shiny you\\'ve got a properly seasoned piece of cast iron and it\\'s up to it\\'s full \"non stick\" potential.\\nGood skillet for the price but factory seasoning is not perfect.\\nprice - very gooddelivery - finepre-seasoned - sort ofcontruction - solidly built and the little one (8&#34;) is actually kind of cutenon-stick - not yet, but...\\nworking on by cleaning it after every use, not applying any soap, and not cooking acidics things in it like tomatoes, and coating it with oil before and after each use.has required a note in it to remind other household members not to use it yet.\\nand means I have to be very, very good about immediate clean up (boil some water in it after cooking eggs to get the white up).\\nIt is just that I know this can/should work so am trying to get some iron and a more traditional (less toxic) non-stick finish.But, don\\'t kid yourself, it takes attention and intention.\\nCoat with vegetable shortening,place on top of coal or wood burning stove,cook for three to five days.I have a Harman Mark 1 coal stove, this stove will boil water in a tea pot.\\nI\\'ve been using my cast iron pans for several years, both in the home and while camping.\\nThe only drawback to cast iron is the weight, but use them for a few months and you won\\'t even notice anymore.Unlike other pans that warp over time, or come warped from the factory, the cast iron always rests flat on the stove burners.\\nThe heat spreads evenly across the pan\\'s cooking surface.\\nThe spout on the lip makes it easy to pour off liquids and grease.I\\'ve never had a problem using soap on my cast iron pans.\\nMaybe that\\'s because I cook a lot of bacon and eggs, and the grease re-seasons the pan each time.\\nIf you\\'re new to cast iron, it takes a bit of time getting used to them.\\nOnce you turn off the heat source, the food continues to cook.I love that I can cook directly over the wood campfire with these pans.\\nCast iron withstands the test of time.\\nOnce you start cooking in cast iron you will throw all your other pans away.\\nI love this iron skillet!!\\nI have cast iron pans big and smal, deep and shallow, a handy glass covered one, flat and ribbed cookers of various sorts, pancake cookers, pots, water heater, cornbread cookers, bacon flattener.\\nMaybe more than 100 lbs.I should get a reward from the Cast Iron Association.A lot of it just happened, given to me, a few antique bargains, an inherited set and so on.\\nBut, I use them almost exclusively, along with stainless pots and such.But, oddly, I had no medium sized pan.\\nWas ordering socks, saw this, applied a credit and here it is, ready for a lot of use.I have several Lodge items, all good.\\nWhat a gift to have a cast-iron pan that didn\\'t need initial seasoning.\\nI purchased this little skillet for my husband who likes to make one egg over lightly every so often.\\nI already have the 10.25 skillet and the square grill pan.\\nThis is a wonderful little pan and it is so easy to use.\\nIt does come pre-seasoned, but I gave it another seasoning after washing (no soap) before first use.\\nI season it with a light coat of olive oil and let it sit for a bit.\\nI have been doing this every time I use the skillet (it takes such a little while), and the results are almost completely non-stick.\\nIt is not necessary to use extremely high heat because the cast iron is so efficient in spreading the temperature evenly.\\nThe larger pans are quite heavy, but the extra handle is very useful so that you can carry them more easily.\\nI plan on purchasing the 8 inch Lodge skillet as well.\\nI needed a new skillet, and this is the perfect size, and came pre-seasoned.\\nI have many Lodge cast iron pieces, and this is just perfect for handling.\\nNo worries with a cast iron skillet about preheating to a screaming hot temperature, as you would have with a non-stick coated pan.\\nNothing like really well grilled onions and mushrooms in cast iron.\\nPre-seasoned means not having to mess with oiling and hours of baking in the oven to get the nice coating.\\nAlways wash this cast iron with only water and a good scrub brush.\\nThis is a great skillet for on top of the stove or in the oven (or both).\\nOnly down side is that they are heavy; the lip or &#34;hook&#34; opposite the handle makes it easier to lift but you\\'ll need oven mitts.\\nThe 12&#34; pan is probably the most useful size.\\nIt is truly pre-seasoned and after a couple of hours in the oven with a coat of oil, I can easily flip eggs without breaking the yolks.\\nI actually grew up with cast iron frying pans, but it has taken me some time to get used to using them again.\\nI highly recommend these to anyone concerned about the chemicals that leach into your food from non-stick coating or traditionalists or even someone who wants to invest in a pan that will last you a lifetime and never need replacing.\\nAnd you probably get some minor iron intake from cooking in them regularly.Follow the manufacturers instructions about not using soap is the most important thing.\\nUse a stainless steel scouring pad or other scrubber (brush, chain mail) to remove food shortly after cooking.\\nI find that if I leave them dirty on the stove for a day or two, the food debris sort of act as moisture on the pan and can create rust.If you ever get a rust spot, scrub it immediately, dry the pan thoroughly (I like to put mine on the stove for 2 minutes on low to warm the pan and evaporate any moisture), and re-oil it lightly with olive oil or coconut oil on a paper towel.\\nThis includes the bottom, which may not make sense to anyone who is grease fire fearful, but we are talking about a light coating to seal out moisture, the pan should look dark on the outside, not shiny or dripping.My best suggestion is to fry bacon!\\nKeep to oily foods like bacon, ground beef, or frying something in oil, etc, until you see them darken up a bit, or even follow the manufacturer\\'s instructions on reseasoning, but do it a few times in a row.It will probably take more than a year of regular use for these pans to develop that smooth bottom that you may remember your mama\\'s pans had, but with proper care and oiling, they will be no-stick within a few weeks or months.\\nAlways use a bit of cooking oil or butter when you heat them up before adding food, unless it\\'s bacon.Best of all, there is no need for plastic utensils to avoid scratching non-stick coating.\\nThis skillet takes up little storage space, and is handy for personal size meals.\\nSome think cast iron cookware is work to keep up and clean.\\nOther than BBQing, cast iron is one of the best ways to get that same seared, BBQ quality.\\nAnd yes, I wash my cast iron skillet, dry it and then I put it in a warm oven or heat it on the stove to ensure the moisture is out of the pan, so it doesn\\'t rust.\\nIn my opinion, it\\'s a healthier way to cook compared to aluminium or non-stick.\\nIn fact, I also use enamel coated cast iron cookware for stews, sauces, etc.\\nRegular cast iron is not well suited for acidic foods, for those get the enamel coated.\\nIt comes pre-seasoned which is nice, but I always apply a thin layer of oil on the cooking surface before use as well as after to keep things cooking beautifully.\\nBeing cast iron, a little TLC goes a long way to keep this skillet in great shape to cook all your food to perfection.\\nThe price I paid was an absolute steal, especially since I could easily get rid of most of my other cookware and use just this piece to cook everything in.\\nCast iron is great for heating and cooking food of all types.\\nThe first time I cooked eggs they were the best I\\'d EVER had!\\nIt\\'s also important to keep a coat of oil on the pan to help with cooking, nonstick, and anti-rusting.\\nWe use cast-iron cookware in our camping trailer.\\nWhile it can be intimidating to see this big black pan sitting on your stove, once you start using your cast iron you\\'ll wonder what else you can cook in it.\\nI can cook four fried eggs all at the same time and they don\\'t come close to touching each other.\\nI cook for just me, so obviously this would be too big for everyday use.\\nThese pans are not super-amazing, professional-grade cookware.I hope you didn\\'t expect that, especially considering the price.But they are just fine, and will perform well, given proper care and regular use.We make pizza in it, and the boys love it.Also great for eggs, tortillas, ground beef, and stir-fried veggies.First of all, disregard the \"pre-seasoned\" bit in the product name.This is to keep it from rusting, not for making a great cooking surface.When you get the pan, wash it thoroughly, scrubbing the inside with a rough rag or really fine steel wool (like #0000).Then coat it with lard (rendered from bacon), and bake it upside down (with a baking sheet underneath) at 250F for about three hours.This will give you a good start on building a great cooking surface or \"season\", which is really polymerized lipids.Then just use the pan a lot.\\nUse a stainless-steel spatula with a smooth edge.Simply wipe out with a paper towel between uses, whenever possible.If it gets really dirty (e.g. has lots of charred black bits in it), use a washcloth and water to clean it up.Never use soap (some people talk about \"light\" soaps and what not; I say no soap at all).Never leave it wet.\\nI recommend sticking it back on the stove for a few minutes to dry it.Eventually, you\\'ll fill in all the little nooks/crannies/pits with polymerized lipids and have a fantastic pan.Don\\'t give up; it\\'s worth the effort.\\nIf you are buying cast iron, think about the weight first and how many in your household.\\nI pretty much stopped using my 3 Calphalon non stick skillets at this point.Here\\'s my take on the ones I own:3qt oven: heavy heavy heavy but the taller wall is good for small batch frying and small stewing jobs10\" skillet: nice surface size; perfect for grilling a big T bone or 2/3 chicken breasts/top sirloins (get a silicone cover for simmering.\\nThe medium size pizza is good for 2 people.9\" grill skillet: strictly for grilling without blackening (the space between the grill is a wonderful heat transferer) therefore not a multifunctional piece8\" skillet: the size is the top not the bottom (the grilling surface); this is the perfect size for a big pancake, a waffle, or a personal size pizza.\\nI use it a lot!mini skillet: the size of a small pancake, a sunny-side-up, and a personal corn bread.\\nIt is a wonderful solo skillet for cooking, serving, and baking.\\nThis is a nice heavy skillet and it\\'s so nice to be able to use it on so many cooking surfaces.\\nIf you already have used or own cast iron cookware then you need no advise.\\nMost recipies call for a 10 or 12 inch size pan so the ingredients should be slightly increased or the cooking time adjusted for the extra area the recipe will spread over.\\nSo far is pretty easy to wipe clean but remember not to use wire scrubber or soap in this seasoned skillet which makes absolutely perfect eggs, etc......\\nGreat pan which am sure will last me for many years.\\nMy wife likes to brown meat in the skillet and that put in oven to finish cooking.\\nI still really only use it for bacon and to fry things like Mozzarella sticks.\\nOne last thing, it is much easier to treat than those heavy big skillets.\\nI bought 3 different sizes skillets, so far this is the one that I use the most!\\nI have a Lodge cast iron skillet for a long time and I love it,I it use for baking,frying,sauteing,stir fry,anything.It\\'s so versatile and food always taste better,so I got this as a housewarming gift for my friends for their new house.I ordered this on a Friday and by Tuesday,it is right on my doorstep,right on tiime for their housewarming party this weekend.Fast delivery,can\\'t beat that!\\nI\\'ve never owned an Iron Skillet before and I\\'m really glad I purchased this one.\\nIt does take a little while to get to the temperature required for cooking but that is a characteristic of all iron skillets so it can\\'t be penalized for that.\\nYou do have to oil the pan before you use it to avoid food sticking to it and I think that is to be expected.\\nThere might be a better way to use it that doesn\\'t require oil, but I\\'m a novice cook at best so I just do what works.\\nThis is my first cast iron skillet so there has been a little bit of a learning curve in the proper way to maintain it.The skillet feels extremely heavy duty.\\nI would recommend this to anybody looking for a nice cast iron skillet.\\nThis lodge skillet is great as usual and I have never had any issue with any of Lodge\\'s products.\\nfor some reason her eggs taste better when she cooks them in this pan..\\nLove this skillet!!When we first got this we tried using it all the time and now we really still try to squeeze it in whenever.\\nGreat skillet to own, cooks everything perfectly, you are sure to be extremely satisfied with it!I would buy again and i would definitely recommend it.\\nThere are not smooth like the old school cast iron skillets but that was to be expected.\\nI love skillet cooking.\\nThis is my second cast-iron pan, and I\\'m happy with this product.\\nThen I can put the cast-iron in the oven without dirtying a separate dish.It\\'s heavy, and I suppose that\\'s a disadvantage, but you know what?\\nI think that will help me keep a good grip, especially if pouring from the pan.This pan might not fit in some tiny ovens.\\nI used a tape measure when ordering to decide which size to get, and I don\\'t know where I went wrong but this thing is way bigger than I thought it would be, and being cast iron, is soooo heavy!\\nBut stainless steel kind of sucks for frying, if you crank up the heat, it leaves burned food on the bottom of the pan.\\nThis cast iron allows higher heat and non stick.\\nI bought this size because I didn\\'t have room for a 12 inch pan and I didn\\'t want something crazy heavy.\\nSince I live in Manhattan and have a galley kitchen I hang my pans on the wall, and you can\\'t do that with cast iron.\\nNothing like an Apple Crisp made in a cast iron skillet on a cold day!\\nI haven\\'t had a cast iron pan before this one.\\nWe follow the use and cleaning directions and are super happy with the way it cooks anything we cook in it.\\nI use this skillet every morning for breakfast and for other things also.\\nBought this as an alternative to non-stick fry pans.\\nCast iron has been around forever, and believe it or not they work just like non-stick.\\nIt goes great with its lid and the lid fits nicely The person I gave this to has an iron deficency.\\nContrary to popular belief you can cook with cast iron on a glass top stove.\\nThe seasoning is good for first time use.\\nA little sticking but gets better I\\'ve noticed on my other Lodge pans with subsequent uses.\\nThey do it soon after the cast pan is removed from the mold and is still hot.\\nI think they do this while the pan is still very hot because the iron is more porous at that time and the seasoning takes better.\\nI scrub my pans with a medium stiffness plastic bristle brush with steaming hot water and this has not harmed the seasoning.\\nI wish Lodge would polish the cooking surfaces of their pans.\\nI have a Le Cruset cast iron pan that I polished down the surface to 400 grit sandpaper and after seasoning it is like glass.\\nIt\\'s as good as teflon without the toxic fumes and about 10% more stick resistant than a gritty cast iron surface upon initial use.\\nI\\'m thinking about doing this to my Lodge cast iron pans but don\\'t want to risk the season not taking to it as good as the original.\\nI\\'ve recently converted to cast iron from Analon anodized proffesional series teflon coated non-stick pans.\\nFood does not stick to a well seasoned cast iron pan if the surface has been prepped properly before cooking each time.\\nI quickly dry my pan and rub a light coat of canola oil on it.\\nI own several pieces of Lodge cast iron cooking vessels and have been very happy with them all.\\nOverall, a $15 Lodge cast iron skillet outperforms in all areas other than weight.\\nI swear that food cooked on cast iron tastes better than food cooked on Teflon coated aluminum.\\nThis pan is on the small side, like for personal use.\\nIt\\'s a great quality cast iron frying pan and it looks good.\\nThis is still the same great quality that I have had over  the years with other Lodge items.\\nI\\'d put off getting a cast iron skillet for ages, always wanted one.\\nI\\'d had non stick fry pans up until now, they worked fine, nothing wrong with them.\\nBut I\\'d always &#34;hated&#34; them because I\\'d grown up using cast iron - no big deal just a minor nagging want to use this type instead.\\nIt\\'s great for conducting high heat and getting that perfect sear- I love it.\\nI was reviewing my past Amazon purchases and see where I bought this item nearly a decade ago.I\\'ve used this skillet thousands of times in the past 10 years, and it is one of my most valued pieces of cookware.\\nAfter so many uses, it has seasoned to perfection and works so great.If you haven\\'t tried cast iron cooking, this would be a great place to start!\\nI generally don\\'t use cast iron pans because they are heavy and bulky.\\nHowever, there are times and certain dishes that you just need a cast iron pan or pot.\\nI use cast iron when we go camping or when I want to make dishes like baked pancakes, stews, chicken fricasee, beans or corn bread.What recommends this pan is that it is pre-seasoned, nicely balanced, impervious to scratching or marring, won\\'t warp, it heats evenly, stands up well even under the most extreme temperatures and is easy to clean.This pan is reasonably priced, well made, and renders perfect baked apple pancakes and Dutch babies, fried chicken, and amazing cornbread.\\nThe side handle/grip makes it easy to handle with a couple of pot holders.My only advice (and I am not sure this is even necessary) is to periodically reseason/cure the cast iron.\\nThere is no other pan that can take high heat on your gas stove, total abuse from your steel spatula, then go straight into the oven for cornbread, next out to your firepit for a couple hours, and all this only makes it better.\\nOnly cast iron actually benefits from frequent use.\\nGreat size for an individual and cooking that corn bread!\\nI bought my husband two cast iron skillets for Christmas and they were his favorite gifts.\\nIf you have never used cast iron for cooking before or have bought into the &#34;it\\'s too hard to use/take of&#34; horror stories, I strongly suggest you give this skillet a try.\\nYes, the cleaning and care is different from &#34;normal&#34; pans, but it\\'s not hard once you get used to it.\\nThe quality of Lodge has never disappointed and the price is right (though I don\\'t know why the lid to this pan costs more than the pan itself).\\nSearing steaks, making gravy or cooking eggs is a breeze and the taste of the food is so much better.\\nOnce you\\'ve gotten use to cooking with it (check out Youtube to help speed up the learning curve) you will wish you had bought one sooner.\\nI forgot how much better things are when you cook with cast iron.\\nI remember the hamburgers that my mother made on her cast iron skillet: thick, juicy, and browned with a flavorful top and bottom that even a charcoal grill could not match.\\nAnd although the slightly rough pan surface made those first burgers a little difficult to turn, they were nevertheless just as delicious as I remembered them.\\nAnd the pan just keeps getting better with each seasoning and with each use, just as any quality skillet should.\\nThank you Lodge for creating a wonderful product--and for helping me preserve a fond memory of my Mom. Just learning how to cook at 30, this thing is incredible!\\nSo much better than stainless steel!I also own the 15&#34; for batch cooking, and it is equally wonderful (although extremely heavy).I can\\'t recommend Lodge cast iron enough.\\nFor those of you who complain about this thing\\'s weight...it\\'s CAST-IRON.What do you expect?!!\\nFor those of you who had the misfortune of receiving a brokenpan....it\\'s CAST-IRON...which makes it solid, but a bit brittle, unlike stainless.And for those of you who love to cook, this pan is a dream-come-true.My wife and I are done with \"non-stick\" pans.\\nToo many reviews (and solid science to back them up) arefinding that non-stick pans are not safe.\\nGreat item to have under your bed too for protection - that 15 inch size makes Repunzel look pretty good swinging it!Anyway, great, great pan, made here in the U.S. A.\\nI am converting all of my stainless steel pots to Cast Iron.\\nI know the NEW thing is NON STICK but I think cast on is easy, goes in the oven easy enough and just a little heavy ....that\\'s why I got the little skillet.\\nI would certainly buy from this seller again and would certainly buy cast-iron skillets.....\\nI love my new cast iron skillet.\\nI use salt (instead of soap and water) to clean this one.\\nI had spent a lot more money on pans which failed to heat as well as my Lodge porcelain cast iron dutch oven.\\nWhen my Calphalon started to chip I decided to go &#34;old school&#34; and pick up a Lodge cast iron skillet.\\nIt took a few tries to season it but I finally have it to the point where I can make most foods and it is just as non-stick as the Calphalon.\\nThe nice thing is that the more you use it, the more seasoned it becomes and the easier it is to cook in.\\nEvery time I clean it (no soap!), I dry it and give it a quick once over with olive oil so it\\'s good to go the next time.\\nCast iron isn\\'t the easiest to care for, but it sure is durable.\\nFollow the seasoning and cleaning directions and you\\'ll have a great pan that\\'s virtually stick free for a long long time!\\nYou can\\'t find any vintage cast iron and you want American made.\\nWe use teflon any time we need something non-stick, and stainless otherwise.\\nUsing this cast-iron skillet has been a real treat.\\nI purchased this preseasoned Lodge 8-inch skillet as a complement to my 10-inch, which is a monster, for use on an induction cooktop.\\nThe price is a steal for a skillet this well made that will last a lifetime.The size of this particular skillet fits perfectly within the heating ring of a typical induction cooktop, for which cast iron is notably suited.\\nWe mostly use it to cook up greasy breakfast foods and steaks.\\nI love cooking in my iron skillet, it gives a much better flavor to food.\\nThe price was nice, how ever the pre-seasoning lifted in the center of pan first time I used it.\\nI have and have used many other iron pans, so I do know how to use and care for.\\nHave all quality stainless pans with NO non-stick anything because I don\\'t want any chemical coating leaching into the food I cook.\\nThis is my first cast iron pan.\\nThis is my first cast iron pan.\\nTakes some getting used to just brushing it out with some warm water for cleaning(NO soap, it ruins the seasoning, takes away the non-stick properties of cast and promotes rust).\\nAnd now use the cast iron for searing meats too!\\nWe live such busy lives that we were hoping that cast-iron simply meant better and more evenly cooked or prepared foods.The unit we got had a very rough surface, with pits and spots standing tall enough from the surface, which meant we probably needed to season the surface multiple times until we got it a nice, smooth surface, according to the other reviews.\\nPlus, the cleaning: I have guests coming through my place who will be adamant of washing this pan the wrong way.\\nFor now, I recently picked up the 12-inch Lodget cast-iron skillet.\\nI don\\'t think cast iron is for everyone, but if you want a more natural alternative to non-stick pans, I think it is worth the extra maintenance work.\\nI also love that I can go from range to oven without worrying about the pan.\\nIt\\'s a great skillet, I use it almost daily now.\\nCast iron pans are great tools for my kitchen and Lodge makes a great one.\\nThis skillet is the real deal and comes and the most perfect price!!\\nThis is a heavy, thick, HUGE cast iron skillet.\\nI\\'m looking for a cast iron skillet like my grandma\\'s, which is smooth on the inside and most of the outside too, making it easy to clean.I don\\'t know how this rough pan cooks and cleans up, though.\\nI wanted cast iron and I got exactly what I hoped for.\\nUse 1/8 cup aka 1 oz scoop in a hot 6.5\" skillet, preheated with cooking spray, and cook until dry.\\nI\\'ve always heard fantastic things about cast iron pans, but I\\'d never owned one.\\nIt retains heat very well, cooks evenly, and cleanup is not the nightmare people often depict.I\\'ve been extremely happy with Lodge\\'s 12-inch cast iron skillet.\\nGot this pan to replace a 12\" cast iron pan that went missing (still don\\'t know where it went..lost it somehow during two apartment moves)This 8\" size is perfect for preparing a small to medium 1-2 person meal.\\nI\\'ve used it to make spanish omelets / frittatas, and it cooks with that \"homey\" feel.Love this pan, and I\\'m sure it will serve me for the rest of our lifetime and perhaps another generation.\\n(If I don\\'t lose this one too) Can\\'t believe cast iron pans were old school and ugly.Yes stainless is shiny and nice looking, but for great results, steady even heat and versitility,I love this pan.Corn bread in this sucker...BAM!\\nI purchased a 10.5 inch recently and then just got the 8 inch pre-seasoned cast-iron skillet.\\nJust go for it....you won\\'t be sorry!I\\'ve tried searing in my non-stick teflon pans but it was just not the same.\\nFor some reason the cast-iron got hotter and gave me a much better sear....and much better flavor!\\nI even made gravy in the skillet after and the clean up was about as easy as a teflon pan....no sticking on the cast-iron!I don\\'t think I will need to purchase the &#34;lodge scraper&#34; or even the &#34;Lodge silicon handle&#34;.\\nAnd I use kitchen tea towels to grab the hot handles from the stove or oven.\\nNo need to spend more than I have to on extras.Yeah, a non-stick pan/skillet has it\\'s place - it\\'s had a place in my kitchen all my life.\\nI just wish I had decided many years earlier to also have a nice relatively inexpensive cast iron skillet in my kitchen too.\\nI would recommend Lodge cast iron wear to anyone.\\nThis \"pre-seasoned\" skillet comes ready to use, although, as the directions state, you\\'ll need to season it from time to time, especially if you want to cook with only a little oil or if food starts to stick.\\nBecause I can\\'t stand the idea of just wiping clean instead of using dishwasher soap, I do wash it, and I still don\\'t need to season it every time.If you are unfamiliar with cast iron, you should know that it is indeed heavy.\\nThe main handle on this skillet is a little short and narrow; fortunately, it comes with a gripping handle on the other side for two-handed lifting.\\nYou also need to dry cast iron immediately to avoid rust.\\nBut you cannot beat cast iron for an even, radiating heat.This particular cast iron pan (12-inch skillet) is deep enough for pan frying, but it works equally well for saut&eacute;eing and even griddle cooking.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann I started craving the taste of child hood cast iron prepared meals.\\nI do feel like I am pumping iron but I am sure I will get better strength.\\nSomeone on a review I had read said to use coconut oil rubbed on these cast iron products and put in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour to keep the treated.\\nThis was my first cast iron purchase and after 3 months of use, it is my favorite and most versatile item in the kitchen!\\nHowever, I wipe it clean after each use with a paper towel, and only wash with very mild/small amount of soap (no scrubbing!) when it REALLY needs to be washed...and I have not had any rust issues!\\nRemember, it is cast iron, so you want that little bit of grease to stay on the pan and keep reheating it with each use to create the \"seasoning\" on it.\\nI love this pan & no worries of chemical coatings leaching into food!\\nThere\\'s a big difference in price and quality; I did some research as I\\'ve never bought cast iron cookware.\\nIf you follow the instructions, you\\'ll get a pan that\\'s almost non-stick, retains heat like no other type of pan and will probably last longer than you\\'ll live!\\nI found it\\'s one of the best ways to cook: steaks, chops, hamburgers, bacon, vegetables, etc..\\nI just got this pan a few days ago, after reading the reviews, which are all true,  and I love it!\\nI too bought nonstick pans because I hated the clean up and didn\\'t like things to stick.\\nThis pan is very easy to clean and food doesn\\'t stick to it at all, as long as you take care of it properly.\\nI got so tired of buying nonstick pans because even though they have those long warranties, they alway seem to eventually stick, and then be thrown away..\\nI never thought a pan could make things taste better until I cooked in this and I swear, you can taste the difference- things have a more intense flavor.\\nThere are no cons about this pan that I can honestly think about, other than it is heavier than your average skillet, but not too bad.\\nI use this pan to melt butter that I brush over corn on the cob that I am roasting.\\nI have found that if the pan is heated up enough before putting anything in it, the food won\\'t stick.\\nI also use soap and hot water with a scrub brush on it, but after I rinse it, I use a paper towel to dry it off, then rub it down with canola oil and bake it on 450 degrees for about 45 minutes.\\nI do this with all my cast iron cookware.\\nSize is perfect for one grilled sandwich or a couple eggs and its cute to boot!Oh, this does need further seasoning.\\nThis skillet is the perfect size: big enough to cook two \"kissing\" over-medium eggs at the same time (or a generous omelette), yet small enough to fit on one of the small back burners I seldom use except to boil water.\\nI can leave this skillet sitting on my stove, opposite my Lodge double grill/griddle, and cook up a bodacious amount of food without having to shuffle things around so much.The 8\" was a little too small to cook eggs for two people...so I gave it to my son.\\nI like to clean/maintain my cast iron by swiping it out with a paper towel after cooking, while it\\'s still warm, and then just leave it in place on the stove without having to lift it over to the sink--except on those rare occasions that I burn something onto it and need to scrub it off under water.\\nI\\'ve cooked in cast iron this way for 35 years and haven\\'t gotten sick from it yet!\\nI only use cast iron but my biggest pan was only  9 in.\\nI bought this and when it arrived I thought, geez this is HUGE and heavy but it has become my &#34;go to&#34; pan.\\nCast iron is the only way to cook.\\nI have used a Lodge skillet for many years, mostly for smoking fish.\\n(Sally Schneider, The Art of Low-Calorie Cooking -- a wonderful book, but only low-calorie if one watches one\\'s step!)The fish can be brined or just basted with some salt (1 t) , soy (2 T), and sugar (1 T) beforehand.Take care not to burn yourself or start a fire in the process.I bought a new skillet because I broke the old one (long story, not a weakness in the manufacture).\\nAs an example, the 9\" skillet has a bottom cooking surface which is 7 1/2\" in diameter.\\nI love and use cast iron as much as possible.\\nSome things just cook better in cast iron.\\nThe right pan for the job is important when learning to cook.\\nBut every cook should have at least 1 of these pans and if you will only have one, the 12&#34; skillet is probably your best all around pan.\\nI don\\'t use it often but it is great for baking in the oven and cooking on my stove top.\\nMy lovely bride did some reading on preparing steak in a cast iron skillet.\\nI still like it for the price and the unusual size and recommend it when purchased knowing what you\\'re getting.\\nThe Lodge cast iron skillet is my favorite cooking appliance.\\nThe grill pan makes cooking healthier but I like it the least because cleaning is a pain.\\nHere\\'s my size guide:15&#34;: Cooking protein for 4-6 people.12&#34;: Cooking protein for 2-3 people.10.25&#34;: Cooking protein for 1-2 people.If you\\'re buying your first skillet, I definitely recommend the 12&#34;.\\nThe other sizes certainly have uses as well, but if know you need a different size from the above, you probably have a good reason :)Always cook with some sort of fat in the pan: oil, butter, lard, etc.\\nTo clean, scrub with kosher salt (it\\'s cheap!), preferably while the pan is still warm/hot, and dry immediately.\\nThis giant piece of iron weighs more than you could imagine...It is worth more in scrap metal than what I paid for it.I shouldn\\'t have bought this giant...I\\'d have been better served buying one size less.\\nIndeed heavy and needs careful handling but overall it\\'s a great product.\\nA bit more labor intensive than stainless or non-stick.The pan is almost 8 pounds and could be used as a lethal weapon against intruders.\\nItappears to be a well built pan without any sharp edges and has a useful second handlewhich will be hot to the touch.In retrospect after having used this pan for over a year I would have to say I\\'d go witha very good stainless steel pan and forgo using the heavy metal skillet unless needed asa backup or for home defense.Happy cooking to all and to all a good night...\\nWhat more can be said about Lodge cast iron?I just made a deep dish skillet pizza.\\nFood just tastes better.Good size for over a camp fire.Amazon shipping was Superman Fast !!!!!!!!!\\nI do like Lodge cast iron cooking equipment.\\nShe gave me two cast iron pans that was her mothers.\\nEvery time I use it I put it on the stove, rub it with oil and let it heat for a little bit and it is one more day to being conditioned like the others.\\n:-)As MUST HAVE for a cast iron pan...Lodge HHMT Max Temp Handle Mitt, BlackHandle mits!\\nDefinitely need that helping handle on the other side of the pan.\\nThis thing is beefy, and needs oil on first few cooks for sure.\\nNo reason to pay more for french cast iron, this one will work just as well.\\nThe possibilities are endless with this skillet, use it for a grilled cheese sandwich, it will work for that too!\\nSince it\\'s cast iron it works on induction cooktops like the NuWave induction cooktops.\\nIt is small enough for those little jobs but big enough that it will be a valuable and useful skillet in your kitchen or camp site!!!\\nI feel if you follow the directions on care, it should last a long time.Handle really gets hot and makes it difficult to transfer it to the sink or move while using it.\\nI have the lodge Cast Iron Skillets at 6\", 8\", 10\", 12\", and 15\".\\nAfter seasoning these myself, they operate far superior than when I first got them...them as in the two pans I purchased...this one and the 10-1/4&#34; skillet.\\nThough it comes pre-seasoned, I still coat it (the entire pan, inside and out and the handle, too) thinly with regular vegetable oil and bake it in a 450-degree oven for an hour.\\nI then let the pan cool completely and repeat the process one more time.\\nIt is true that you need good kitchen ventilation to do this though not over-coating with oil cuts down on the greasy smoke considerably.The pan now looks amazingly shiny and nothing sticks to it.\\nEverything comes out great and above all, no worries about non-stick chemicals, etc.I do repeat the seasoning process every so often purely for asthetic reasons because I like my entire pan to be equally black!\\nI prefer to cook with an open flame and the Cast Iron pans distribute the heat evenly and help with the cooking.\\nWhat I really like about cast iron is how well things fry up and brown.\\nThe heat is distributed so well and things look and taste great after cooking in these pans and pots.\\nI use oil to keep the pan working well so if you are a non-oil cooker you might not like that aspect.I\\'ve been using Cast Iron to cook with most of my life, born and raised using Cast Iron and I have to say it\\'s really a great way to cook.\\nWith time my pans are nice and dark and develop their own nearly non-stick surface.\\nThe lids are interchangeable between the cook top pans (like this one), the cook tope ovens and the camp pans that have legs for use with Charcoal.\\nThe similar sizing also helps with storing things since you can stack them nicely in your pantry.Things I prefer to cook in Cast Iron are meats and anything oily.\\nI do NOT like to cook things that need to be boiled such as rice or spaghetti in Cast Iron, use other pots for that.If you can find one of these at a garage sale or thrift shop, grab it up.\\nClean it, season it and it\\'ll last you forever too.In order of how often I use my Cast Iron, I\\'ll list types, sizes and most common usesLodge 5-quart Dutch Oven (loop handles or wire bale) same size as 10\" camp oven; used for cooking meats and family sized casserolesLodge 10-inch Skillet; used for frying up breakfast, grilled cheese and much moreLodge 7-quart Dutch Oven; same size as 12\"camp oven; used for larger family mealsLodge 12-inch Skillet; used for frying larger meals and when camping or groups at homeLodge 8-quart Camp Dutch oven (legs); used for outdoor charcoal camp mealsThere are special Cast Iron cookbooks that have unique ways to use these pans and ovens too, give one of those a try and you\\'ll find many new and tasty things you never thought about cooking in a pan before!5 stars, you can\\'t go wrong with a cast iron pan.\\nCast iron is excelent for general purpose cooking, and Lodge Logic makes good stuff.\\nPlus, the fact that it comes seasoned means it\\'s ready to use straight out of the box.Cast iron is naturally non-stick, and so minimizes the additional chemicals that your food comes in contact with.\\nPlus, the lack of an artificial nonstick coating means you can use a metal spatula or fork to stir and not worry about it reacting with the surface of the pan.It\\'s not perfect for every situation, though.\\nBut It\\'s in a dark corner of the kitchen, and the Lodge Logic is right on the stovetop.The only thing that holds it back from a perfect score is that, in my experience, the pre-seasoning is a bit shoddy.\\nI lost the origional seasoning just a couple of weeks after getting the pan.\\nBut, of course, a couple quick coats of crisco, a couple trips through a hot oven, and it was back up to 100%.Every cook should have a good set of cast iron.\\nShe thought it might be too large and was also worried that she didn\\'t have a big enough burner to heat it, so was going to trade it with me for my 12&#34; iron skillet...until her son and husband saw it.They talked her into keeping it.\\nI assured her that a good iron skillet will heat evenly on any source of heat.\\nIt is far, far inferior to the better cast iron skillets of the 1930\\'s.\\nI have a Griswold cast iron skillet from that period and it is 1/2 the weight of this Lodge skillet.\\nThis Lodge skillet is just too heavy.\\nSimply put I would not recommend this skillet for most women its just too heavy, and could be dangerous if dropped.Still having said that this skillet is affordable, and the pre-seasoned coating is a plus.\\nSo dont give up on it if you dont like the results the first time you use it.The bottom line is if you want a one handed skillet dont buy this.\\nIf you dont mind lugging this heavy thing around with two hands it cooks acceptably well.I\\'m not sure what modern cast iron ware there is out there today which doesnt weigh a ton but this isnt it.\\nI seasoned it in the oven over 5 times with flax seed oil.\\nI also bought the lid to go with it, which makes for each quicker cooking time.\\nThe best cast iron skillet out there in my opinion.\\nWhen I was picking out the basics for my kitchen, I never thought I needed a cast iron skillet.\\nAs I got more into cooking and amassed a small army of cookbooks, I realized that every single one of my cookbooks assumed that I had a cast iron skillet for at least one recipe.\\nWhen Alton Brown used a cast iron skillet to make delicious looking burgers and tenderloin I noticed he used a \"Lodge\" brand skillet - so imagine my surprise (and delight) to find out how incredibly affordable a pre-seasoned skillet was!Yes, the care instructions make it a little more difficult to wash - but it\\'s not tedious and there is a lot of information on the web with tips to make the process easier.\\nI cook on an electric coil stove (no gas hook up) and cooking with the skillet has been a joy - once preheated, the heat is conducted evenly.\\nCertain foods (like fried eggs) are much easier when cooked on the skillet than in my Calphalon pans.While I\\'m not ready to ditch all my pots for cast iron, I am very happy that I did decide to add this to my collection.\\nSteaks, bone-in chicken breasts, peppers- there are so many foods I love preparing in a cast iron skillet.\\nA 12&#34; pan is large enough to cook two chicken breasts at once, or two small steaks.\\nThe pan is very heavy and does require special cleaning (brush out residue, wipe clean and apply oil) .\\nI had Grandmothers Lodge skillets have no idea how old ( way over 70+ years)..\\nThese are fantastic, I actually learned about Lodge Cast Iron in Mexico.\\nI remember that I was impressed and called them Henry Cabot pans so I would remember after the statesman, Lodge.That was 30 plus years ago, I am not sure I remember the gals name  I dated.\\nWhen I opened the box , which had big yellow tags HEAVY USE CARE, I pushed away the plastic air filled bags and attached to the handle was  an American Flag Tag , on the other side was a smaller flag WITH BOLD TYPE LETTERS, Made in the USA.\\nI am planning on getting a smaller pan  soon.Maybe we can do something like in Finland, who has the best schools in the world these days, teachers must have a masters and teaching credentials,many teachers have been in business retired early and teach.\\nAnd I am going to make a note on the will to make sure themom who makes  sure my place is clean gets the Lodge Pans.\\nOnce you learn how to cook with cast Iron all other cookware falls short of the bennies it offers.\\nHolds heat a long time after cooking, gives even temp throughout pan.\\nI simply place breasts in skillet season then place foil over it and put it in oven @350 45 min take off foil 20 min before done to crisp up skin.\\nOther skillet I cut potatoes, onion, 1 pepper, little olive oil, season throw in oven for 45- 60 min and the pan browns and cooks a perfect dinner.\\nEasy to clean I dont use anything else, even serve from skillet.Reheat pizza is the best!!\\nShut off heat under pan place pizza slice in skillet and cover and in 10 min you have slighly browned crust and just a perfect reheated slice, well worth the wait taste better then fresh to me.\\nIf you use butter or spray before you cook even eggs dont stick.\\nFrying is the best, burgers in the pan place lid and it will brown as they cook as well.Its all in learning how to heat and use pan since it holds the heat long, but once you master it nothing cooks food and can crisp food like this.\\nHeat pan up good throw in veggies and cup of water cover the heat will steam them perfect then throw in butter as water evaporates butter covers veggies, makes them perfect.I also read that cooking in cast iron will supply natually iron into your diet, is it true ?\\nTo me it does not get any better.Plus they will outlive you if you season and take care of them and you can hand them to your off spring like Grandma did.\\nIt\\'s certainly no Wagner Ware, but this skillet (using medium-high heat or lower) is a wonderful thing, not to mention priced very competitively.\\nI didn\\'t mind the pre-seasoned surface on this particular pan.\\nBreakfast, eggs, baked dinners, just about anything you can throw at it--and it cleans out nicely.Verdict: For the price, I would highly recommend it!\\nWhen it comes to frying or searing a heavy cast iron pan is the best for the job at hand.\\nNone of them perform as well as this very inexpensive cast iron pan for stove top frying or searing.\\nThese pans are heavy and the handles get hot.\\nAs a Southern cook, cast iron is essential in my kitchen.\\nIt cooks on high heat, in both the oven and on the stove top.\\nGreat for baking cornbread or searing steaks on high heat.Cast iron is not nonstick (don\\'t know where that came from).\\nWhen cooking, you want to first heat your pan and then add oil or butter after the pan is hot.Never use soap on it; that is one secret to keep it from rusting.\\nDry it immediately with paper towels after use; then put it on a burner on low heat and let it sit for about 3-5 minutes, then turn off the heat.\\nFrom time to time, season per directions.If you have never seasoned a cast iron pan, rub it lightly with oil, and place it in an oven at about 350F for about one hour.\\nWipe away the excess oil with paper towels and store the pan for its next use.If you take care of it, this pan will last your lifetime.\\nI\\'m really beginning to use this Lodge 8-inch skillet regularly and like it a lot.\\nWell, it does hamburgers to perfection (one at a time - this is not ha huge pan) too.\\nBut I\\'m sure, since this is cast iron it would stand being placed in the hottest oven for some recipes.\\nYou, too, may learn to love cast iron cooking!\\nJust fill the pan with hot water after it cools a little after you finish cooking.\\nLet it soak a while and then scrub it with a teflon pad, or a brush, or use a scraper (Lodge sells those), and all the residue comes off.\\nPlace some cooking oil in it for the next time after drying it.\\nI purchased two of these skillets to use for breakfast skillets for my wife and I and we love them.They are your standard Lodge Logic skillets but in a smaller size, which is the perfect size for breakfast.We make them, spread the cheese on them and pop them into the toaster oven to melt the cheese.\\nThen we can serve it directly at the table, one skillet for each of one and the heat from the iron keeps the food hot while you eat.We also have larger skillets that we could use and have people serve themselves from it, but the individual skillets make a much better impression.We\\'ll be buying more so that when we have guests, each person still has one.The only complaint that I have with it, which I have about all Lodge Logic skillets, is that the surface is fairly rough, unlike some older (no longer in production) skillets.\\nI have given my son all of my older cast iron ware and just bought a 10 inch Lodge pan with helper handle.\\nThis pan will stay on top of stove for regular use.\\nNicely pre-seasoned--sure, it will improve as you use it more, but it\\'s nice to have it start out usable right out of the package.\\nThe delivery guy does give weird looks for the really heavy flat box *chuckle* I\\'m new to cooking and this pan is insane.\\nI\\'m not new to baking and have made some killer desserts in it, too (like a one-pan skillet cookie).\\nThis skillet came pre-seasoned and with more space than I will probably ever need.\\nIt definitely takes some strength to pickup this skillet and you will want to be sure that you can do that with liquids and foods in it.\\nI have had the Lodge 12-inch skillet for over a year, and liked it a lot.\\nIt\\'s basically just as &#34;non-stick&#34; and easy to clean as Teflon-coated skillets, but without the risk of the coating scraping off over time and rendering the pan unusable.\\nCast iron pans can truly last forever if you care for them properly, and for under $20 this one is absolutely a steal.\\nFor some time now, as my chef skills have been improving, I had been wanting a cast iron fry pan.\\nThis one was reasonably priced and pre-seasoned, so I bought it together with aT-fal E9180764 Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Expert Interior Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator Anti-Warp Base Dishwasher Safe 12-Inch Saute / Fry Pan Cookware, Gray, figuring that one or the other would eventually make a good replacement for my warpedRachael Ray Hard Anodized II Nonstick Dishwasher Safe 12-1/2-Inch Skillet, Orange.\\nThe cast iron is very flat and the pan retains and distributes heat very evenly.\\nThe trade-off is that the pan is extremely heavy, and of course, both the handles get blazing hot, making it doubly unwieldy.\\n(I boughtLodge ASHH41 Silicone Hot Handle Holder, Redto solve part of the problem.) Obviously, the thermal properties of the cast iron are this pan\\'s big selling point, but I was not impressed with the \"non-stick\" qualities at all.\\nAfter washing, I went to the Lodge website for instructions on re-seasoning the pan, and I thought I had followed them correctly, but when my pan emerged from the oven on the first seasoning attempt, it was sticky with a stubborn, baked in layer of dried oil.\\nNow I\\'m left with having to scour, scrub and re-season (again) if I want to continue using this pan.\\nNothing sticks to it and no seasoning is required.Cast iron makes great heirloom kitchen gear, but as good as this pan is for cooking everything but eggs, it\\'s a real chore to care for and doesn\\'t perform like pans with modern coatings.\\nIf you are a traditionalist with time on your hands, or you want to get a good bicep and forearm workout while cooking, this Lodge frying pan may be just the ticket for you.\\nIf you just want to cook food with a minimum amount of work and time spent maintaining your kitchen gear, I would recommend T-fal over this product.\\n(That said, I went to the Lodge website, followed their re-seasoning instructions to the \\'T\\', and my pan is as good as new.\\nWon\\'t try to cook eggs in it again, but otherwise, I\\'m happy, which is why it still musters four stars.) (This is an update of my original review, now that I\\'ve been using this frying pan for ten months.)I\\'ve been using cast iron frying pans all my life and was glad to see this being sold on Amazon at half the price my local hardware store gets for it.\\nIt\\'s the first pre-seasoned cast iron pan I\\'ve owned.\\nI was skeptical about it and wondered whether I should look for one used or at least not pre-seasoned.However, the pre-seasoning works great, although after a few weeks of ownership I did season it myself, but this was because cooking at too high heat had damaged the pre-seasoning.\\nWith proper care, there\\'s no reason why someone can\\'t still be using it a hundred years from now.Like all cast iron pans, it requires proper care.\\nHere\\'s how I keep my cast iron pans in good shape:1) If the pan is new and not pre-seasoned, or if it\\'s been abused, I put it in the oven for several hours at around 100F with vegetable shortening covering the bottom of the pan.\\nIf a pan\\'s been really abused, you may need to clean it with oven cleaner, but this is a drastic step that should be avoided if possible.2) Always cook at low heat.3) Before cooking, allow the pan to warm up at very low heat with cooking oil in it.4) Clean it with a dry paper towel.If a dry paper towel doesn\\'t completely clean it, use cold water and a sponge, but this will remove some of the pan\\'s seasoning.\\nThere is very nearly no better way to cook, unless you spend ten times as much on a pan.\\nI bought a few diffrent sized Lodge cast iron pans to use on my grill and have loved the results.\\nI use them right on the grates of my Weber Genesis to cook bacon, pancakes, vegtables, fajita meat, or anything else that would fall through the cracks.\\nI always make sure to put a light coat of oil on the pan after I use it.\\nI have also used the pans inside to make a few different things in the oven and have had equally good results.\\nCancelled the Amazon order (but still have the 5 quart dutch oven and the Sante cast iron loaf pan on order) which stated a 5-7 week!!\\nWas a little concerned about whether the pre-seasoning would really result in a non-stick first use due to some of the reviews on here.\\nCleaned it with water and a brush, dried it, placed it on the burner for a couple minutes, paper toweled some oil on its surface and it\\'s beautifully black and ready to use tomorrow.\\nI am considering buying the next size up for two people.I like cast iron a lot though and this one is great for one person.\\nthis is my second cast iron purchase .the first one was 8 inch i love it so much that i decided to buy 12 inch.\\nwell worthy I use this pan almost every day.\\nI have a small family, but like to cook a double-batch of almost every main course for leftovers, and this pan allows me to saute without boiling everything.\\nAs with all Lodge Logic pre-seasoned cookware, I gave it another coat of seasoning (peanut oil) and baked it in the oven at a low temp for a few hours before using it.\\nAs far as storage goes, I have a warming drawer in the bottom of my range that accomodates this skillet and my two 12\" cast iron skillets just fine.\\nI rarely use high heat with cast iron.\\nThis skillet ROCKS - and what\\'s better is that it\\'s made in the USA!Easy to clean too.\\nBeen cooking for years, had heard all the buzz about cast iron but never used it much.\\nI wanted to get away from synthetic non-stick cookware and got this pan.\\nGreat price, it IS basically non stick ( eggs are still a bit of an issue) and although I thought the size might be too big for my two-person household, it really is just perfect.Being cast iron, it IS a bit heavy, but if you don\\'t have any physical limitations, it\\'s perfectly workable.\\nThis skillet is a little smaller than what I wanted, but I didn\\'t realize that until I got it.\\nI kept it because who can\\'t use a variety of skillet sizes?It wasn\\'t \\'seasoned\\' as much as I like, so I seasoned it again when it arrived.\\nIf you\\'ve never used cast iron before, there may be a learning curve for you, but if you persevere you will figure out the best ways to use it.Overall, I really like the skillet.\\nIt\\'s great quality, reminiscent of the old cast irons my grandmothers had.\\nI will stick with this brand from now on...and I think I\\'ll got for the 12&#34; one next time, since I do need a larger skillet.\\nSmall and relatively light and easy to use and store it is a perfect size for when you dont want to take out a larger skillet.\\nAfter waiting a month to get the thing because it was back-ordered, I FINALLY got to try out my skillet.\\nMost of my cookware is garden-variety non-stick and hardly suited to things like searing steaks or fajita meat.You can run this pan as hot as you dare without hurting it - works great for steaks, and makes an awesome cheese steak.\\nThe pre-seasoned coating works as advertised, and the cast iron gives good heat transfer and VERY even heat across the entire pan.\\nI think I\\'m going to be using this skillet A LOT.A handy suggestion regarding cleaning that I stumbled across on another website...\\nImmediately after cooking, fill the pan with HOT water (not cold; you could crack it!), put it on high heat, and bring the water to a rolling boil...\\nDump the water and immediately wipe dry with a paper towel, set on the (turned-off) burner briefly to dry completely, and wipe the cooking surfaces with oil.Another note - want those steaks well-done but juicy?\\nBuy the Lodge Logic 5-qt Dutch oven; the lid fits this skillet!\\nSear both sides of the steak on medium-high (about 3 min each), then flip, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook as desired, flipping the steak once along the way (about 5 minutes per side for a small, well-done filet mignon).\\nYour cooking times may vary, but the combo of cast-iron skillet for searing and lid to keep things moist while cooking works exquisitely.\\nLodge Logic is always top quality and this small size is very handy for a single person, side dishes or small ingredients of recipes.\\nWe have a lot of fish fries and we still prefer to pan fry over deep fry and this skillet is perfect!\\nAnd the cast iron makes heat control a breeze!\\nI have a number of Lodge logic pieces...grill pans, skillets and a Dutch oven, and I love them all.My family has cooked in cast iron since I was a kid.\\nI like it as it does cook stuff better than our non-stick frying pans.\\nPros:Durable cast ironGreat for pizzas and steaksCons:Takes a while to get seasonedNot the best for some things like eggs even after seasonedCan\\'t leave it soaking lazily in the sinkOther:The 12 inch skillet fine for making pizzas but for everyday use its a bit too large, I also have an 8 inch which is perfect Now, do not buy this if your marriage is rocky because one bang on the head with this skillet will knock you cold.\\nWhen it comes to searing steaks or frying up a mess of bacon (or, for you vegetarians, eggplant), there\\'s no replacement for cast iron.\\nCOAT PAN WITH BUTTER, AND COOK ON MEDIUM LOW HEAT UNTIL THE EGGS SET UP.\\nCAST IRON IS THE ORIGINAL NON STICK SKILLET.\\nI\\'m still using the Lodge Cast Iron Skillet that my mother got for a wedding present in 1954!\\nCast Iron is ALWAYS a superior value for the money, and this pre-seasoned version takes the hassle out of \"getting it ready to use.\" Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a Lodge Cast Iron Skillet and Dutch Oven!\\nIt is just the right size and of course you can\\'t go wrong with cast iron.\\n(ha!)  I don\\'t use the rubber handle cover though...it doesn\\'t fit tightly and I don\\'t feel it holds the pan securely, so I just use a pot holder if I need to move it or pick it up.\\nOne great skillet for frying bacon and making corn bread.\\nI was visiting someone who had a big cast iron pan like this.\\nI have often heard in the past how people liked their cast-iron cookware.\\nThought I\\'d try it with a small purchase, so I ordered this small fry pan.\\nThe very first time before I used it, I added about two tablespoons of lard, set the gas stovetop on low, let it melt, then used a paper towel to wipe it all over the Pre-seasoned pan.\\nA good size when the kids aren\\'t home and I\\'m only cooking for one.\\nIt has never rusted, has had to get re-seasoned only once due to a slight over drying on the stove top after washing, and nothing sticks in it.\\nLOL We really like the fact the skillet is pre-seasoned.\\nThe additional small handle makes it easy to go from stove-top to oven.\\nI remember my mom and aunts used the old iron frying pans when I was growing up, so we wanted to give it a try.\\nBaked iron frying pan will stink up your kitchen.\\nThis was quite a disappointment, especially as I remember my father and grandmother cooking with cast iron skillets.\\nI loved those pans and everything that came out of them.That red handle is amazing.\\nPre-seasoned skillets is the only way to go.\\nI use it every day and sometimes oil it so the skillet isn\\'t bare.\\nWe will be getting a good workout handling this pan.\\nPan is great quality.\\nI was always scared of cast iron because I know that if not taken care of them well they can rust.\\nI had always wanted a cast iron skillet, but for some reason, we never got one.\\nThis little frying pan is exactly what I wanted, you can sear a food and then safely put it into a hot oven.\\nI think every kitchen should have at least one cast iron skillet.\\nIt can be used for anything but the best use I found for it is \\'Shakshouka\\' (look it up!) served to the table boiling hot in the a cast iron skillet.\\nIt\\'s also great for steaks, burgers and hotdogs if you want to prepare them on your stove although Lodge has skillets that are better suited for that.I heard that Lodge is the brand to get.\\nbut looks good and i hope that the food doesn\\'t get stuck like it has happen to others I LOVE Lodge cast iron cookware.\\nThese pans get better and better with use, and you aim for that \"black glass\" finish that another reviewer mentioned.\\nUntil that point, however, be aware that even the pre-seasoned cast iron is not going to give you the nonstick performance of a pan with a true nonstick coating.\\nI use my cast iron for as much as possible but keep a couple of nonstick skillets for frying hash browns and eggs because, frankly, my cast iron still tries my patience with those items.\\nIt\\'s not gonna be sufficiently non-stick to fry eggs for awhile (unless you don\\'t mind cooking with alot of oil or butter).\\nThat said, cast iron works BEAUTIFULLY for just about everything else.\\nI use this for a lot of cooking.\\nI still get a small amount of sticking when cooking eggs, but i think that could be a temperature problem.This thing makes an awesome steak.\\nThe silicone handle was a nice addition, but is not useful for lifting, you still need to use an oven mitt because this thing is heavy.\\nLodge makes the BEST quality cast iron cookware.\\nI own several other brands of cast iron and this is the skillet I use the most.\\nBecause of this, I will never buy cast iron online again.\\n(olive oil of course!) Well Lodge makes just such beast, it\\'s the \"Lodge Combo Cooker\" Same size, only comes with a lid that doubles as a flat griddle.If you need a 10\" skillet get the combo cooker instead you will be much happier.\\nI\\'ve rid myself of all my frying pans and replaced them with Lodge Pre-Seasoned Skillets.\\nThey are the best because the food is cooked evenly and clean-up is a breeze!\\nYou just need to remember to season your pan with about 1/4t of oil before putting them away and they will last a lifetime.\\nLodge is the best and lasts forever if taken care of properly which is a no brainer.Thanks Amazon - Love you too.Grandma Nel This cast iron Lodge pan is fully seasoned, ready to go.\\nThis pan is so heavy even when empty it made me use it less and less.\\nPersonally, I found that with just the standard pre-seasoning, chicken breasts and stuff do stick to it.\\nWhen I first started using cast iron, I didn\\'t know how to properly use it.\\nAbout 60-30 minutes before I\\'m ready to start cooking I put the skillet on medium heat and pretty much forget about it for 10-20 minutes, season with oil and turn of the stove.\\nAfter a few re-seasonings, this skillet is a dream, cannot express how much I love this thing!\\nEven though it is way bigger than our electric burners, it still works great as the whole pan heats up.\\nAluminum and teflon cooking surfaces both have serious health concerns, so I won\\'t cook on anything but stainless steel or cast iron.\\nI had a large cast iron pan that was not a Lodge, it was awful, it did not heat evenly and did not keep its seasoning.\\nSo far I have not been disappointed, the skillet has performed flawlessly, it heats evenly and keeps its seasoning.\\nI highly recommend this skillet and other Lodge ironware products.\\nWe are new to the cast iron world after we researched and found out majority of non stick pans are so dangerous and bad for your health.\\nI\\'m pretty strong but I\\'m thinking I might just skip my weight lifting workout and just cook with my new heavy cast iron :)  (joke).\\nNeeded a good priced pre seasoned old fashioned cast iron fry pan, this one fit all my parameters.\\nLittle extra handle opposite the main handle is good for weak wrists like mine with a hot mitt or  Ove Glove Very nice cast iron skillet, I\\'ve never been disappointed in any of Lodge\\'s cast iron pots and pans, just my opinion but I think they\\'re the best!\\nReading the reviews of Lodge skillets, I get the feeling that the cast iron skillets have a considerable cult aspect.\\nI have an ancient 12\" iron skillet that works very well for browning meats and for good heat distribution.\\nOne caveat: do not start with frozen foods, I did and the frozen glazed-seasoned vegetable meal stuck like crazy glue.\\nI really enjoyed this skillet for cooking small meals, but was very disappointed when the handle fell off soon after I received the skillet.\\nI use this for a small chicken fryer 2 or three pieces with lid (Lodge Logic L5IC3 Cast Iron Lid, 8-inch  ) and any time cook on the stove using an 8\" skilletthis will last a 100 years If it dose not grow legs and walk awayI rub all my cast-iron with vegetable oil after each use the perfect nonstick surface gets better with use and can be renewed if needed This is the pan I started with to go back to cast iron after years of trying all kinds of teflon coated and plain steel types.\\nThis pan came to me perfectly seasoned and ready go.\\nI threw away all of our non stick pans years ago and switched over to cast iron.\\nWhen seasoned correctly they work as well as regular nonstick, except they cook much better!Get this pan piping hot, add a tiny drizzle of oil to the meat after seasoning then toss into the pan and you will get the most perfect crust.\\nAlso nothing beats using a cast iron pan for frying potatoes and onions!\\nI usually set the pan back on the burner to finish drying off while I finish cleaning up then wipe a small dollop of bacon grease  over the surface so it will be ready for next time.\\nIf you have some hard to clean messes all it takes is a tiny bit of water and let it simmer for a minute and it will release the food, then just rinse, dry, and add a bit of oil or grease.After using these for so long I just can\\'t see myself using anything else to cook on.\\nThis pan is the perfect size for 2 people.\\nI can cook 4 pieces of Turkey bacon when I cut them in half and then I can use the pan, with the very little amount of dripping and all the seasoning to make the eggs!I have used this pan inside the house and out on the fire pit.I have made an &#34;apple brownie&#34; and regular brownies in it in my inside oven.Because it\\'s LODGE it cost\\'s a bit more, BUT it is well worth the lifetime of use you will get from them.\\nThey\\'ll outlast you, your grandchildren will be able to use them and then theirs too probably.I have used other cast-iron skillets and pans.\\nI believe the quality of LODGE is much better and when pre-seasoned, which this comes as, it starts accumulating flavors from all the food you cook in it.Never wash LODGE with soap and water.\\nI do leave &#34;stuff&#34;, herbs and oil residue in my pans after I use them.\\nIf you use water then please completely dry and if you store it with a lid put a spacer between the lid and the skillet.\\nYou don\\'t want rust on any cast-iron.LODGE makes wonderful scrappers for cleaning and there are silicone handles to remove hot pans from the oven or around on the stove.\\nThe skillet is bigger than I wanted but it is a great product and will last forever.\\nIt is hard to beat cast iron cooking about anything.\\nDon\\'t know if they make it in the US or Bangladesh, but it does a great job on my blackened fish.Will one day use it as a present for one of my ignorant, undeserving, pseudo-chef of a friend.\\nThe only new cookware entering my house will be Lodge cast iron (and not some cheap knockoff).\\nI\\'ve used it for several years and every time one of my old (non cast iron) pots dies, it gets replaced with Lodge.\\nIt\\'s just the best for cooking, easy to clean, and the handles never break.\\nThis is the 4th Lodge Logic brand cast iron pan I have bought and I love them all.\\nThis one is perfect for sauteing small items or for cooking 1 egg.\\nThe old fashioned iron skillet.Keep it clean, but not scrubbed with harsh pads, or other.\\nBefore I use it each time, I rub a tiny bit of Coconut Oil all over the inside of the pan to just \\'season it\\' a little bit.\\nWorth the investment easy to pick up with 2 hands Ya\\'ll out there looking for the best price on cast iron cookware should  look no further.\\nI\\'ve had no problems with any of Lodge cast iron cookware.\\nI recently purchased the Lodge Logic skillet specifically to cook a corn bread recipe.\\nI\\'ve been a single guy for the past ten years and cast iron was low on my list of cooking tools since I was not really convinced that it was healthy.\\nEven though I grew up in the late forties and fifties with my mother frying everything in her twelve inch cast iron skillet, I was a bit squeamish about having one myself.\\nI know I\\'ve got to give this pan a chance and only have used a couple times because my eggs stuck horribly both times.\\nI\\'m hoping with time this will be as effective as my non-stick pan.\\nI grew up with cast-iron (pre-Teflon days)and know the benefits.\\nI still use the non-sticks for casual and fast cookings but use cast-iron the majority of the time.\\nI love to cook and like to feel connected to my cookware (weird, huh?) Once they are seasoned properly (properly is key), they are very hard to beat for anything other than recipes that call for non-reactive cookware.\\nYes, any cast-iron does need to be seasoned but it takes much more than one introduction of \"oil to heat\" to achieve that seasoning.\\nOne has to cook several, if not many times in cast-iron for it to become indispensable.\\nAfter the first few times of cooking and cleaning the pan, coat the inside with an almost undetectable smear of vegetable oil and heat it up briefly on the eye.\\nIt prevents rust and makes the pot or pan easier and easier to clean the more it\\'s used.\\nthis is a pretty heavy iron skillet and i love it, it distributes heat very well and keeps heat for good period.\\nHeats evenly and well, and is the perfect size for toasting spices and seeds- I use this on cumin a lot, prior to grinding it for my cooking.\\nGreat little skillet, highly recommended.\\nI had never used cast iron before, but I heard it was great for anemics and people that want to avoid the chemicals in nonstick pans.\\nEvery time I re-season it looks as good as new.When I first received it, I washed the pre-seasoning off and re-seasoned it with with grapeseed oil.\\nI should have cleaned the pan by boiling some water in it to loosen the remaining food.\\nThe soap had removed the seasoning, but the pan was fine and was easy to season again.It is a healthy choice and helps support American jobs.\\nIt is a very heavy pan so if you are older it may not be a good choice unless you have help in the kitchen.\\nWish I would have bought a set of cast iron skillets years ago.\\nThis pan is a little heavy and it supposedly weighs 5 lbs...but with food added makes it seem like 10 lbs.\\nIt seemed to be already seasoned well..but i just added a bit of corn oil before cooking anything 1st time and wiped it over inside and stuck in oven ..and in 1 hour of sitting in oven at 400 degrees..it seems to not have ANY issues with sticking afterwardsThe food is great after cooking inside it and it is so easy to cook with.\\nJust add the ingrediants and put a lid over it and set in oven and come back 1 hour later and it tastes as nice as a dinner at a high priced restaurant.Btw would recommend getting the lid that goes with this by Lodge too...but problem is it weighs as much as the pan..so look at another 5 lbs added to already 8-10 lbs of pan and food to lift out of oven.\\nMight use it for other things as well, but for now, it is perfect for my needs.\\nI did do additional seasoning when it arrived by lightly coating with oil and baking in our toaster oven at 400+ degrees (out of doors to let it smoke real good!)  Did this 4 times and it really added a nice slick coat to it.\\nFirst we thought we got a big pan but this turned out very good size to do anything.\\nI recommand smaller size for everyday use.But I like this pan.\\n10% for All clad skillet,  10% enameled dutch oven, and maybe 5% non stick skillet for eggs.\\nI\\'m no stranger to a grill either.I have this skillet, and the 15&#34; cast iron skillet when I cook for larger groups.\\nWe were using the non-stick store bought set which of course we all know we have to be careful with what we use in them as they scratch easily.\\nThe reviews that say otherwise seem to be mostly from people who are not familiar with how to properly care for cast iron.\\nI purchased cast iron after trying several brands of pots and pans.\\nMy mother and grandmother (and various aunts) used cast iron, and I\\'d never tried using it because I didn\\'t want the upkeep that goes with them (you can\\'t leave wet to dry, have to season each time, don\\'t use soapy water, can\\'t stack with other items, etc).\\nHowever, after having numerous frustrating experiences with other pots, pans, and skillets, I decided to fork over the money to get the cast iron that I knew would work, but is more work to use.\\nI have actually found that using cast iron is less work in the long run.\\nEven things like eggs, which are notorious for sticking, are easily cooked and the slight sticking of any residue is very easy to just peel up with the spatula.\\nIf you do wash wet, you just use hot water and a brush, if necessary, and dry thoroughly (immediately, so it doesn\\'t rust).\\nThe great thing about seasoning is that it is automatically ready to cook with the next time you need it for things like stir-frying, saut&eacute; type stuff, etc.\\nThe more you use it, the more well seasoned it gets, and the better the surface for non-stick appeal.\\nYou can use them on a variety of surfaces, and they\\'ve done really well for us during things like camping, over fires...\\nMy son is two now, and my pans are a natural non stick that are way better in heat distribution and non sticking.\\nMade in the USA in the south, by people who know cast iron.\\nThere is just something comforting about cooking in a cast iron skillet.\\nWe have many pieces of expensive cookware but nothing works as well as this American classic.Searing a steak or saut&eacute;ing eggs are examples of everyday use.\\nIt is also the only pan we can put in the oven or use on our barbecue grill.\\nAfter roast is done, I just put it on a platter to rest, place still hot pan on stove top turned on high, & make the best gravy!\\nCast iron is the only way to cook and I do a lot of cooking.\\nEvery body knows that a good cast iron skillet is an essential tool for frying chicken.\\n2008 I purchased a Lodge 12&#34; cast iron skillet for $25.00 on Amazon and used it as my main piece of cookware.\\nI use it for almost everything, last year I started to use it to make Pan Pizza, the top of the 12&#34; skillet is 12&#34; but the bottom is 10&#34; , a 10&#34;: Pan Pizza is enough for me but if I have company I would have to make two pizzas, so I purchased the Lodge 15&#34; cast iron skillet and the diameter of the bottom of the 15&#34; skillet is 12&#34; it is only two inches more but it seems like it is a lot bigger and more filling ( I posted a photo)I enjoy reading the customer reviews of the Lodge products and somtimes find useful tips for cooking with mine.\\nI have been so scared to try Cast Iron Skillets  that I almost put it off again.\\nI have really enjoyed cooking in both of these skillets.\\nBut the clean up has not been a problem and the cooking has been great....\\nI just make sure I clean it after cooking (I don\\'t let it set) and only with water and a brush and season after every use.\\nI would recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook.\\nI got the tiny one and is perfect for cooking single meals for myself or when I\\'m using my larger ribbed cast iron skillet to make smaller things like garlic toast or a couple of brats.\\nMy larger skillet is just that, larger and takes up an entire square on the stove so, with this being so much smaller it works perfect for cooking duel burners.I don\\'t think I could be any happier with this skillet!\\nSo happy with my first cast iron skillet purchase!\\nI bought this last year as a fluke after hearing about cast iron on cooking shows.\\nPros:1- Pre seasoned, but I added another seasoning layer myself.2- Even heating- it comes to temperature and stays there.3- Easy clean up with a little boiling water, a brush, and if its really dirty I brush in a bit of salt.Con:It is heavy.I heartliy suggest that everyone get one of these pans.After trying it out, I bought a 5qt.\\nThe quality is excellent, clean up is a breeze and food cooks so nicely.\\nWe purchased one of those \"chainmail\" deals to clean these pans and those work like a charm.\\nWe\\'re so pleased with the Lodge cast iron pans and are so glad we converted from \"non-stick\" to cast iron.\\nGood ole Made-in-the-USA cast iron...of course it\\'s awesome.\\nLodge has been making this stuff for a long time and they know what they are doing.\\nIt arrived ready to go...pre-seasoned and included the silicone hot handle grip.\\nI use this skillet so often it basically just lives on my stove.\\nI live alone and usually cook for one, and this skillet is the perfect size for me.\\nI debated between this and theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 6-1/2-Inch Skillet, and I\\'m glad I chose the 8 inch pan.\\nSo this small skillet lets me fry up 2-3 slices of tofu without wasting too much oil - perfect!I\\'m a recent convert to cast iron, and I\\'m cooking more than ever just to have an excuse to use the skillets (in addition to this one, I also own theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle, which is perfect for tortillas and pancakes, and theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker, which is perfect for...well, everything else).\\nYum!One note: I personally recommend not cooking with olive oil in cast iron pans.\\nAnd once it\\'s smoked, it leaves a sticky residue in the pans, no matter how hard I scrub with a brush under super hot water.\\nI\\'ve been happily using safflower oil, which is a neutral flavored, high heat oil that cleans up easily without soap.Bottom line: I love this pan, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who\\'s willing to use and care for it properly.\\nI really like this and cooking is better than my stainless steel.\\nMissed the cast iron pots and pans my Mom and Grandma had...still think there is really nothing better, you can keep all the new fangled cooking utensils...the \"old\" work beautifully...\\nThe Lodge Logic line is great, easy maintenance, great cooking results.\\nThe silicone handle fits perfectly and the size of this pan is awesome!\\nJust a pro tip for cast iron: pre-seasoned is a bit of a misnomer.\\nThe seasoning they have on the pan will keep it from rusting and is good for greasy foods, but its not good to start with something like, say, eggs.\\nYou will need to add additional seasoning to the inside of the pan for that.\\nI suggest starting off with something like bacon or sauteing onions, and then seasoning the inside of the pan only a couple of times before you attempt that fritatta or omelet you were super excited about.\\nThink of a pre-seasoning on a cast iron pan like a primer on a wall, you still need to add to it.\\nWorks excellent, is non stick once fully seasoned, and USA made.Not much more to say, other than we really like the silicone handle, it stays cool enough to use without a mitt, yet removes easily if we ever want it off, and slips back on quickly and easily.\\nIt makes a good griddle, is non-stick and holds a lot of food.\\nOverall it is a must-have pan and the one I always reach for first.Kitchen Collection (website and store often found in outlet malls) makes a lid called the \"Extra Large Multi Cover\" that fits this pan perfectly and makes the pan even more versatile.The skillet is rather heavy, but with the helper handle, it has not been a problem moving the thing around even when full of food.\\nThe pre-seasoning is a start, but I just lightly washed it and then reseasoned it first thing.\\nIt has been entirely non-stick for everything from eggs, to green beans to meats since.The pan\\'s actual measurements are 15\" across the top and 12\" across the interior bottom.\\n10-15lbs...LOVE that cast iron!\\nit takes while to heat up, but it definitely keeps the heat going!i\\'ve used this skillet a few times now, some that come to mid are the roasted quails and veggies, and another for fired and roasted prawns and paella.\\ni love it that you can use these on the stove, and then stick em\\' in the oven to finish off the cooking of whatever you may need to braise or sear first.\\nBecause I have a moderate case of arthritis in my hands, I was a little concerned that the 12\" skillet might be too heavy to lift, but -- thanks to the second handle -- it\\'s manageable.\\nHere is the deal...it can be used on the stove, in the oven, over the campfire to make the best meals you ever had...fries up bacon perfect then oh, the eggs...pancakes golden brown...create tons of corn bread mixes.\\nDon\\'t drag it around on your glass top stove...Be sure to put this in your will as several family members will want it as it is a piece of cookware that last for generations if you give it the proper care...Get several sizes...this was just for a one serving cook project.\\nAs I\\'m getting older, I needed a pan a little smaller, but large enough to cook 4 hamburgers at a time.\\nI love the size, and Lodge products are always fantastic.\\nBoth my wife and I like to cook potatos and eggs in the morning.\\nBut several high-end nonstick pans were ruined by the high heat needed to brown the potatos.\\nWe dug our lodge 12\" skillet out from our camping suplies to get us by while we were looking for a nonstick that would hold up to the heat.\\nIf you have a normal sized stove, you should expect to lose the usage of one of your adjacent burners/elements.It\\'s so damn big that I\\'m not sure I\\'ll use it that often.\\nThis skillet is easy to use, cooks food very evenly, and cleans up easily using just hot water and a scrub brush.\\nAs long as you dry it after use on the stove (at low to med temp), then add a few drops of oil and spread it around with a paper towel while the skillet is still hot, and let it cool that way, you\\'re good to go.\\nExcellent quality, and the extra handle helps because skillets are heavy.\\ni bought this pan to avoid the initial seasoning process.\\ni do clean it with water immediately after use, and then heat it to dry and apply oil.\\ni\\'m sure i\\'ll get to the point where i\\'ve built up the seasoning layer and achieve a \\'non-stick\\' surface, but i\\'m not there yet.\\ni do really like how meat tastes cooked in this pan as differentiated from teflon pans.\\nI have gotten two of these...one I primarily use to fry eggs, and the other as a saute pan when cooking for myself.\\nThis pan is the best tool for perfect roast chicken, hands-down.\\n(this depends on the size of the chicken; chicken is done when the thickest part of the bird has reached 165.) Remove the skillet from the oven, and you will have a golden bird, on a bed of potatoes that have been seasoned in all that lovely roast chicken juice.\\nI don\\'t like non stick due to the toxic chemicals and you must always replace them, even the high quality ones that are expensive must be replaced no matter how careful you are with them.\\nBut cast iron lasts a lifetime, acts just like non stick and doesn\\'t have anything toxic in them.\\nI have a 12 inch cast iron skillet that was a bit too big for everyday use, especially when making omelettes for my kids (small sized), so I ordered this skillet.\\nIt was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I use it all the time: grilled cheese sandwich, omelette, melt butter, small quesedilla, etc.\\nAnyway, this size is great if you have small children or cook only for yourself.\\nThis is the best all around pan to use for cooking.\\nKeep it clean and seasoned and you can cook anything in it.\\nI got this larger size so I could cook everything from pancakes to curry in one pan.\\nClean up is easy, simply boil a  cup or two of water in it and then use a stiff brush to scrape off the junk.\\nWhat a great skillet for the price My wife and I have been looking for a non-toxic/non-stick method of cooking for a long time.\\nThe old fashioned Iron Skillet is it!\\n\"Zero Stickage\" Just ensure you clean and care for the pan as described and it will last a very long time.\\nBetter for the environment - not using dishsoap and I can cook eggs in it without sticking.\\nAnything you cook will be done so to protection, let me tell you, a d no matter how you cook it- electric, gas, camp fire or coals, cast iron is it.\\nI got the 10.25&#34; cast iron skillet to use instead of a regular non-stick and I find it to be just as versatile.\\nI find that it gets a crisp coating on the eggs much better than a regular non-stick skillet.\\nOnly downsides to the cast iron is it takes longer to get up to temperature and longer to cool down and its def heavier than a comparable size modern non-stick skillet.\\nSo far I have been able to clean it with just hot water and a sponge and once dry I give it a very very  thin coating of olive oil and store it.\\nOf course, when it make sense to do so.So far this is a great skillet for small jobs.\\nThe more you use it, the better it will get.I have to say that I really love this skillet.\\nGranted, I haven\\'t tried them but I think the 8 inch pan seems to be the best size for me.Here\\'s a bit of advice on this skillet.\\nIf you want to use it fry eggs, then try what I do.\\nIt will take a bit to warm up, but it will definitely warm up good.Once it\\'s ready, I coat the bottom and sides of the skillet with butter.\\nCrack a couple of eggs into the skillet and let them cook until they are ready to flip.\\nIt will also make you look like a pro if you can flip them with a flick of the wrist.If this didn\\'t work for you and your eggs stuck, then your skillet just needs some mileage.\\nRemember to wipe down and oil your skillet after use.\\noverall a great product, the preseasoned makes this skillet ready to go out of the box, highly recommended, great flavor There are tons of ways people can season cast iron but let me share something I\\'ve yet to find anywhere: use a cotton, BBQ basting mop for seasoning.\\nAfter thoroughly towel drying your pan, heat it on the stove.\\nCast iron is porous so it makes more sense to get the pores open so you can clog\\'em with grease.\\nIf you see smoke, take it off the burner.Instead of using X many paper towels & burning your fingers, rub the oil into the pan with the basting mop.\\nAfter the pan cooled, I heated it on the stove, added a little butter, & hardly any egg stuck.\\nDON\\'T WASH WITH SOAP!!!!You know the pan\\'s seasoned nicely by the sound your metal spatula makes.\\nI use my skillet everyday & don\\'t regret the purchase 1 bit.\\nGood luck.update: If you don\\'t wanna fry bacon, use coconut oil.\\nFrying an egg is the best test, & I love it when the cheese easily lifts off the pan.\\nI love cast iron cook ware and this one fits the purpose; however, the weight is not as heavy as the others I own; not so happy about that.\\nAs with all lodge cookware this will last forever and is almost impossible to damage.But Be Warned, This is one HUGE pan.\\nMy 14 inch pans look lost inside this thing.That said, I like this pan very much.\\nI have my grandmother\\'s beautifully seasoned 12 inch Lodge skillet.\\nOut of respect I still use it for certain recipes, but my 10-1/4 inch Lodge skillet is the workhorse in my kitchen.Fortunately for you the \"new\" Lodge does have the helper handle...and you can use it for a life-time and still pass it on your children.I have 30 years experience in the manufacturing industry and have been responsible for the purchase of several thousand tons of metal castings.\\nLodge has the best cast iron for food service available anywhere in the world...and their quality control is second to none.\\nI love this pan for meat, It cooks one of the best steaks I have ever had.\\nNot so great for eggs so far maybe will get better after seasoning for a while.\\neasy to clean, just add some water while still warm and scrub with brush then wipe out with dry cloth.\\nAs far as cast iron goes, this is about as perfect as can be.\\nAlthough I always diligently season my cast iron pans after nearly every use, and could get away with a pan that wasn\\'t pre-seasoned, I still think buying a pre-seasoned pan makes a lot of sense because you can get started cooking right out of the box.\\nIt also gives you a head start on your own regular seasonings--it takes care of those difficult first 3 seasonings for you.On my first use of this pan, I pre-heated the pan for 3-4 minutes, used a little canola spray (not much) and fried an egg.\\nIt\\'s just brilliant, and I use it whenever I cook meat these days--it just always tastes better.\\nLodge Logic has a good reputation for their cast iron products.\\nWe have a wood stove and I was looking for cast iron products that we could use if there was a power outage of some kind.\\nafter going through all of the coated pans, teflon, enamel, I have come to realize that the old traditional cast iron pans are the bestthe lodge logic is made here in USA and is absolutely the best buy around Took the plunge and bought this cast iron skillet as I was tired of buying &#34;throw away&#34; nonstick pans.\\nCooked eggs this morning and they came out completely stick free!\\nWill be buying more cast iron-need a griddle next.\\nThis is my favorite cast iron skillet.\\nAnd the iron lid that *is* available for the 10\" Signature Series skillet (link inserted above) was priced at $45 directly from Lodge.\\nFood Network\\'s Alton Brown recommends a cast iron skillet for cooking steaks.\\n(...)The great price of this skillet prompted me to give his recommendation a try.\\nOver time, our skillet has slowly replaced most of our much more expensive pans and I love being able to not worry about scratching or damaging it when using metal utensils.\\nIt\\'s great for any kind of frying, chicken, fish and you can even do a steak though I will say that this is a smokey process indeed.To pan-grill a steak, grease the pan lightly and sear the steak on each side, testing the meat for done-ness by pressing on top.\\nPinching these will give you an idea of how done your steak \"feels.\" When finished grilling, remove steaks to a warm plate and you can deglaze the pan with a swish of cognac or wine, add a swirl of butter for a very luxurious sauce.Washing this pan requires hot water..and no soap.\\nThis keeps the seasoning from being removed by detergent and makes the pan almost as non-stick as a teflon pan, though of course not quite.\\nI always season my cast iron - new, or used (hey, I don\\'t know WHAT someone else used that old piece of cast iron for - maybe cleaning auto parts).\\nThese mistakes give the same result - a sticky brown coating that is definitely not non-stick, and the first time they bring any real heat to the pan, clouds of smoke that they neither expected or wanted.\\nI see several complaints here that are completely due to not knowing this.But there were a few pieces I needed (yes, needed, cast iron isn\\'t about want, it\\'s a need), and this was one of them, so I thought I\\'d give the Lodge pre-seasoning a try.\\nThis time, I was going to give the Lodge pre-seasoning a chance before I broke out the sandpaper.\\nSo I scrubbed the pan out with a plastic brush and a little soapy water, rinsed well, put it on a medium burner, and waited.\\nCast iron tip number one - give it a little time.\\nCast iron conducts heat much more slowly than aluminum, so you have to have a little patience.Then I threw in a pat of butter, and brought out the natural enemy of badly seasoned cast iron - the egg.\\nBesides, it\\'s kinda fun.Here\\'s cast iron tip number two - season at the highest temp you think you\\'ll ever cook at - or higher.\\nIf you don\\'t, you won\\'t get the full non-stick thing, and the first time you bring it up to that temp you\\'ll get clouds of smoke from the unfinished seasoning.\\nThis is a good thing - that\\'s smoke that won\\'t be jumping out to surprise you the first time you try to cook with any real heat.\\nDry, absolutely no stickiness, black as a coal mine at midnight and shiny - but still bumpy - could it possibly work with that rough surface?I put the skillet back on a medium burner, put a pat of butter on and tossed in a couple of eggs.\\nIf there\\'s anything that cast iron likes less than fried eggs, it\\'s scrambled.\\nJust a quick hot water rinse with a brush in case something got left on the pan (I couldn\\'t see anything, but hey), then I put it on a med-hi burner till dry, put a thin coat of lard on the pan and waited until I saw smoke for a minute.\\nDone.So. do I like the bumpy texture of the Lodge pre-season?\\nThe Lodge pre-season isn\\'t a perfect surface out of the box - but it does give you a big head-start.\\nAfter a night\\'s work, my iron is ready to face anything, and you just can\\'t beat that.Lodge makes a great product.\\nFor the quality, durability, and versatility, you can\\'t beat Lodge cast iron.\\nIf you\\'ve never experienced cast iron cooking, you\\'ve just been cheating yourself.\\nJohnnycake adds the crackle of a fried crust, and the only way to attain it is with a cast iron skillet, like Lodge\\'s Logic Pre-Seasoned 12-incher.Since it\\'s pre-seasoned, it\\'s like inheriting that coveted been-in-the-family-for-years skillet without waiting for someone to die.\\nMany gourmet chefs insist on cast iron for searing meats and preparing pan gravy or sauces, no matter how the meat is going to be finished.\\nIf you really want to see the family\\'s eyes pop, serve up some plate-size pancakes for breakfast this weekend.In the oven, cast iron holds the heat better than anything else.\\nWhile the batter rests, put your Lodge Logic skillet on the stove, lay in 2 or 4 strips of bacon and fry \\'em up good and crisp.\\nMelt half a stick of Nucoa margarine in the skillet instead of frying bacon.\\nButter will burn at these temperatures and the delicate flavor will cook out, so save the butter for when your Johnnycake comes out of the oven.You could even use a cooking spray, but don\\'t come crying to me if it\\'s not as good.\\nWas he using one of his Chinese-made EmerilWare

some oil on a paper towel and then drying upside down in a warm oven for a hour is perfect.\\nThe oiled surface helps the performance of cast iron cookware.\\nThe traditional handle is too short for a good grip on such a big pan.\\nThe nail hole is dandy for hanging the pan (like from the buckboard of your Conestoga wagon while heading West across the prairie) - I just wish the handle were long

my folks had cast iron skillets that were just plain abused.\\nI actually like taking care of this pan and I\\'ve got everyone trained, if you use it, brush it, no soap dry it and spray a fine layer of vegetable or canola oil on it and put it back in the oven.\\nIf you\\'re a person who doesn\\'t clean pans until the next day or several days later, don\\'t bother with this pan, you\\'re too lazy to own one.This item comes pre-seasoned from the factory and let me tell you it\\'s a fine start that just improves with use and proper care.\\nI bought the Lodge brush when I ordered this pan and I\\'m still using that same brush, it\\'s almost time for another but it\\'s a good buy too.\\nIt\\'s fun to use and it heats your food like no other surface.\\nMy favorite thing to cook is simple breakfast potatoes, it browns them well and I use a lid from another pan set that fits perfectly.\\nMy skillet has served me well and I\\'m going to buy a smaller one and eventually replace all teflon surfaces with cast iron.\\nAlthough I don\\'t think I\\'m quite ready to fry an egg properly, I will figure out a way without having to use nine cubes of butter.\\n;-)One thing to be aware of is the way cast-iron reacts with garlic and vinegar.\\nIt wasn\\'t the most appealing color as it reminded me of food-gone-bad but I read later its a natural reaction between the iron surface, the sulphur in the garlic and the vinegar.If you buy this pan, consider the slip-on handle pad and definitely buy the stiff brush from Lodge.\\nMy nieces husband got this for Christmas to go with the scrapers and CST iron fry pan.\\nJust make sure to keep it seasoned so nothing sticks This is a true cast iron skillet.\\nIt has a nice weight to it, heats evenly and cooks food to perfection.\\nThe seasoning added at the factory has something to be desired, but I never really expected to last longer than it would take for the pan to naturally season while cooking.\\nI am sure with the high quality of cast iron this skillet is made from, I can hand this down to my daughter.\\nMy food tastes better especially my steaks because I can put the cast iron in the broiler.\\nAlso because the cast iron allows for the meat to be evenly cooked throught out the entire pan no matter where the heat source is.\\nBonus I have never owned or used a cast iron skillet.\\nThey sell some Lodge skillets like this at Walmart, but when I got this one today and lifted it, I knew those at Walmart are made to be lighter.\\nWe have several of these pans from Lodge in varying sizes.\\nThis is the first cast iron skillet I\\'ve bought; the last one I had was a hand-me-down.\\nThese skillets can really last a very long time if properly cared for!\\nThis pan is a very nice size and the only downside to that is that it\\'s difficult for me to lift it in/out of the oven one handed like I used to do with my old skillet.\\nI use this primarily to make pan-seared steak, and it works perfectly for that purpose!I would definitely recommend this product!\\nI love cooking with cast iron (wish I still had all my mom\\'s old pans...) and starting to rebuild my collection.Wanted something larger that what I had so I got this 12&#34; - and it is bigger than I thought!\\nLove using it for &#34;range to oven&#34; recipes.Would also make a great deep dish pizza pan, thought I prefer my 17&#34; cast iron pan for that :)Lodge makes great products that will last a lifetime with the proper care.\\nThe only trouble I have ever had with cast iron cookware is getting the seasoning right.\\nMy goodness I love this pan.\\nYour flame (or other heat source) should be about the size of the bottom of the pan.\\nLodge is made in the U.S.A. and is the best quality cast iron cookware made.\\nIf you like cast iron, and I really do (I really don\\'t like eating Teflon) this is an outstanding pan for an outstanding price.\\nI cook everything on this from breakfast foods on the burner to pizzas in the oven.\\nI use this skillet way more than anything else in my well-supplied kitchen arsenal.\\nFor me, the benefit of cast iron is that it holds and distributed heat evenly.\\nPeople have different approaches to cleaning cast iron - I personally use a brush and soap and water and just re-season the pan every so often.\\nI personally put my pan back on the burner to dry it after washing to avoid rust.\\nThe price of Lodge cast iron can\\'t be beat, but the low price doesn\\'t mean compromised quality.\\nI used to think that the best cookware is anodized aluminum Calphalon with the most advanced non-stick surface.\\nWell, there still is a place for those expen$ive pans, but old-fashioned cast-iron cookware is now my favorite.I already had the 12\" skillet and the rectangular grill pan, and decided to get this one because it\\'s only [...], even though the 12\" pan would probably do what this one would.\\nWell, for the price, I like having this size -- I cook for one and it\\'s perfect for 2 pork chops.\\nTo give you an idea of size, two pork chops fit perfectly in the pan, and 3 pork chops make it very crowded.Cast iron is as non-stick as it needs to be.\\nChicken breasts, steaks, burgers, chops all turn out well when cooked in this pan because the pan holds its heat and sears in the juices.\\nI put water into the pan after cooking (after it has cooled down a bit), eat my meal, and then use a scouring pad without soap to clean the pan.\\nThen I heat the pan up a bit, put a small amount of oil in the pan when it is dry and hot and wipe it around with a paper towel, leaving a very thin coating of oil.For the price, [...], you can\\'t go wrong -- if you are cooking for more than one though I recommend the 12\" pan.\\nThis versatile 6-1/2\" cast-iron skillet is for smaller cooking tasks, perfect for two eggs or bacon fried potatoes for one serving.\\nPre-seasoned with a vegetable oil formula and ready for immediate use...\\nCast-iron construction heats slowly and evenly, keeps heat longer, use on low/med heat setting.\\nReally enjoying this pan for browning, searing foods, especially chopped onions.\\nBought this pan specifically for cooking scallops and it has not disappointed.\\nI cook for myself, so this little skillet is the perfect size for 3-egg omelet in the morning, or veggie saute for dinner.\\nI am a small to medium sized female w/ skinny arms, but this skillet is not too heavy so I can still lift it w/ one arm.\\nIt\\'s not really non-stick because the eggs won\\'t easily slide off the pan like they would from a good new non-stick pan, but it\\'s much much better compared w/ my stainless steel skillets.\\nAs long as you soak the pan in water after cooking, by the time you finish your meal, the food residue can be easily washed off with a brush or sponge.\\nI use a nylon dish brush with hot water and cleaning is very fast and easy.\\nThe skillet is relatively heavy but even with my small hands it still feels as if the handle only fits half of my palm, so it forces your hand to hold it really close to the hot pan - really bad design.\\nIt has turned into a multi use pan and I love it This was my first cast iron skillet.\\nDecided to try cast iron in an attempt to get away from Teflon.\\nI am now hooked on cast iron and love this 12\" skillet and the 8\" skillet.\\nWe use this skillet now more than any other pan in the house.We both love this cast iron skillet.\\nThis is a great iron skillet and the perfect size.\\n...first off dont even attempt to fry eggsin this skillet for at least 2 weeks of using....when i recived mine i washed well in hot water, even tho it seasoned your gonna wanna do it theright way...after washing put on top stove to dry,then cooked bacon in it, you are gonna wanna useanimal fat as much as possiable.....it did stick but thats toobe expected with first time use, then i towel dryedthe extra grease and added lard....put in oven at 500degrees, expect some smoking, just have fans ready, for1 hr...turn oven off, i did this like 3-4 times...thencooked fried potatoes with onions ,worked great, friedan egg and it slid off pan...great pan, just got dutch oven too...\\nI prepare a lot of stir-fry requiring even cooking at high temperatures, and have not needed a wok.\\nAnd I couldn\\'t make my crispy bacon skillet bread without cast iron.\\nMy brother is a big cast iron fan, he has two Lodge cast iron pans which he has owned for years.So I decided to get one, since he would always make great steaks, chops, omelettes, and potato\\'s in his.My new pan (I got the 12 inch) arrived quickly and safely packaged.\\nThese ones from Lodge are pre-seasoned, so you\\'re ready to go as soon as it arrives.\\nSome people like to do an extra seasoning coat anyways, but I didnt bother and it made no difference.My first attempt was to fry a ribeye by pan frying it quickly on each side and then puting it in a high temp oven for a few minutes to finish it (for the recipe I used Google - Alton Brown\\'s cast iron ribeye recipe).\\nWhile my steak was resting, I quickly scrubbed my pan with some warm water and salt.\\nI then oiled it a bit after cleaning but before putting it away.My 2nd attempt was some quartered red bliss potato\\'s which I baked in the pan at 500 degrees with just oil salt and pepper.\\nAgain, I scrubbed and re-oiled my pan while it was still warm.Im pleased with how easy it is to clean, and how mine has already turned black and shiny, and non-stick.The trick is to follow the care guidelines, these things rock.I think I might get a 2nd one so I can do steaks/chops and sides at the same time.5 Stars.\\nCast iron skillet with a &#34;Cool&#34; handle.\\nif you like to cook like we do, ya just gotta have one of these and it\\'s pre-seasoned so you don\\'t have to do that part of a new cast iron skillet.\\nThis is a great piece of cooking gear for our kitchen.\\nIt\\'s small but enough for about 3 fried eggs or one grilled cheese at a time.It came pre-seasoned but it looked like it needed a bit more work so I oiled it up and put it in a hot oven, which I then turned off but left shut and the next morning the little pan was ready to go.It cooked well and washed up well after that.\\nI like the little loops on the Lodge Logic pans, I hang them over my wood stove when not in use and they look very nice.\\nThis skillet is too large to use on my indoor stove.\\nUsually a dap of coconut oil for lube and low heat and the even distribution makes easy work of it.\\nYou really cannot beat how a cast iron product cooks food.\\nWe decided to switch back to cast iron after having burnt or scratched too many teflon or silverstone type pans.\\nThe more I read, the more I am convinced that cooking with these synthetic pans may be dangerous to health.I used cast iron for years and only quit because I heard it destroys vitamin c.\\nUnless you need one this big I might suggest a smaller one, maybe 10&#34;.What I love about this pan is that it is pre-conditioned.\\nThe last cast iron pan I bought (which is a smaller one), I had to condition it myself and it took time and effort.\\nWhat I like about the big one is that it can be used for smaller things, whereas a small one cannot be used for bigger things.One thing I\\'d like to see is an option to get it shipped with a fitted leather or silicone handle pad as if you cook on higher heat for a while the handle WILL GET HOT.\\nI do have a handle pad somewhere, that I used with my old (smaller) cast iron pan, I just have to find it.\\nI\\'ll have to check.But ALL cast iron pan handles get hot and I suggest you buy a handle pad and get in the habit of using it.\\nI bought one of these pans to replace my non-stick fry pan.\\njust beware of the different method of cleaning for these iron skillets or an iron cook items.\\ntaken good care of, I can see this pan lasting me a lifetime of daily use.\\nI didn\\'t expect it to be that big, I think a 10in skillet would have been better but this is great for making lunch/dinner.\\nI never get that from my normal skillets.It is heavy and always careful not to drop it, I\\'m ok if it breaks but I am afraid of losing my toes haha..good thing it has a handle!Cleaning is a breeze too!\\nI clean it with soap and sponge then completely dry it, that spray it with PAM then wipe the excess oil off and heat it for a while and then store.\\nIt is a bit heavy and don\\'t think you could flip food, but it cooks food faster than my other pans.\\nJust remember to season this pan after use.\\nI would buy another Lodge cast iron pan again.\\nOne of the things I love to do is to make an entire meal in a skillet.\\nI haven\\'t tried any cast iron skillet baking, but I\\'m thinking I might make a cookie or a cake in this thing.\\nI still wipe it down with oil after each cooking and if I ever have the oven on, I put in there for the ride to keep somewhat seasoned.\\nStill not non-stick yet (unless a lot of greese in the pan) so I hope it will work  soon!\\nArrived on time, well packagedIs as describedThis is one HEAVY skillet!\\nso be prepared to deal with the weightThat aside, it will be just what you need to fry chicken, deep enough and the heat will be well distributedIf you already have the Dutch oven, you have a lid that will fit this skillet.\\nThese pans are great if you take care of them.\\nThe only reasonable complaint I\\'ve seen posted that doesn\\'t apply to broken pans or other such one-time issues is that the cooking surface is much more pitted than older pans.\\nIt only takes  a couple of minutes (other than the re-seasoning) and will be the only difference between this pan and a very expensive cast iron pan put out by other brands in the fancier stores.\\nI just bought this skillet this weekend and have already used it three times.\\nEasy enough just to wipe it off when I\\'m done with it, then I rinse and scrub it without soap in hot water right before I use it again (I use it a lot) so I don\\'t have to worry about rust between uses.\\nGreat price for something that will last forever, gives food amazing flavor, browns things to perfection.\\nThis is a great preseasoned cast iron skillet.\\nThis is the quintessential cast iron pan everyone should own.\\nLodge has excellent quality, and this is the perfect size to start with.I would avoid cheaper cast iron as they tend to be irregularly formed and heat differently across the pan, which can ruin what you\\'re cooking.\\nI was raised by a dinner-from-the-box type of family, so cooking with cast iron was an entirely new concept for me.\\nWe recently just restocked our kitchen, from plates and flatware to non-stick pans.\\nI decided to buy the Lodge 8\", 10 1/4\" and 6 1/2\" skillets along with the 10.5\" griddle about 10 days ago.\\nIn fact, I find myself using these far more than the non-stick skillets we purchased around the same time.I\\'ve had no problems with rusting due to following instructions, which is always important.\\nI also made an attempt to watch some how-to videos off YouTube, which helped tremendously as well (Alton Brown has some handy ones on there).When I first used these, food did stick quite a bit, despite using oil, so I decided to start applying oil after each use.\\nI now am in the habit of rinsing/scrubbing when I\\'m done, I dry it down and then heat it back up on the stove as I apply a thin layer vegetable-based oil, which seems to make it more non-stick.\\nNot a must-do sort of thing, since it\\'s already pre-seasoned, but I\\'m loving the results.\\nI just received this skillet today....did a quick wash with plain hot water, dried it, put it on stove...then proceeded to fry up a catfish dinner!\\nSpent the last hour cleaning out my cupboards and I filled up my trash can tonight with 3 yr old &#34;green fry pans&#34; that performed lousy and a chipped, rusted and cracked enamel-lined-cheap-China-knockoff dutch oven.\\nThis great Lodge skillet has a new home on the back burner of my stove.\\nIt\\'s big heavy cooks great last forever what else could you ask for.\\nMake sure you want a big, heavy skillet before you order this one.\\nWe gave away our older set of cast iron ware when we decided to lighten our kitchen utensils for camping.\\nNothing beats a real cast iron skillet from Lodge.\\nI like cooking with cast iron and this is not a let down.\\nI do get stuff burned on (not like my non-stick pans) - but it cleans pretty easily.\\nI am convinced that this is a great product and that\\'s the reason why the chicken comes out so good.\\nWell seasoned, I put a little oil in it, let it heat up and made a whole breakfast from potatoes, grilled tomatoes and of course eggs.\\nIt worked great, no sticking, potatoes turned nice and brown, eggs perfect all on medium heat.Then the test.....clean up.\\nNow 40 breakfasts later....each better than the next.I just love it and do not have to worry about non-stick coating health hazards.Just to show you new is not always better.\\nClean immediately after cooking and just coat with a little oil for the next one.\\nThis is good quality and will be a pan that I use for a very LONG time to come.\\nAnyone interested in buying quality cast iron cookware should consider this company.\\nThis is a fairly small skillet, 8 inch, which is the right size for some things.\\nThe sides are fairly tall for a small skillet (1.75 inch by my measurement, inside measurement), which I consider to be a good thing.\\nThis is pre-seasoned and is ready to use right out of the box.\\nAs far as cooking performance, it\\'s cast iron so it\\'s great.\\nI also like that a cast iron lid is available for this pan.\\nI hesitated many years to buy cast Iron.\\nThis skillet is  a perfect size for my family.\\nI did  not buy a cast iron lid for this--prefer the Lodge tempered glass lid for use on top of the stove.\\nI do not use soap, run hot water in it after cooking and clean it  with warm water and the Lodge scrubber brush.\\nAlways rub a little oil on it, and stick it in the oven a few minutes before I put it away.\\nI love this pan!!!I use this for broiling & roasting food in the oven, for roasting seeds and flour on the stove, and for normal stove top uses.\\nIt is HEAVY, but I just keep it in the bottom drawer of my oven.SEASONING AND CLEANING:Before using it the first time I did a quick \\'seasoning\\' technique I learned from my wok: take green onion ends, chopped up and saute them rubbing them around the pan \\'till they\\'re burned.For cleaning, I just use hot water and a scrub brush...\\nWe use this pan every single day.\\nWe also use it for other everyday cooking and some baking.\\nI also bought a HUGE version of this pan for when we have company and are cooking a higher volume of food.\\nThis skillet was the perfect size.\\nI bought this skillet and the lid for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them both!\\nShe says they are high quality and she can now cook all of her pork chops at one time!\\nAbout the only thing I wish this skillet had was a longer handle which is why I gave it four instead of five stars.\\nAs I recall, cast iron skillets used to have longer handles.\\nWe needed a larger cast iron skillet and this is perfect.\\nCan\\'t beat that it\\'s made in the USA - it had the little card stating this, and I\\'ve noticed people ask this question on other cast iron products so I thought I\\'d mention it here just in case this interests you.\\nThis pan should work great in our large Big Green Egg ...\\nI cannot believe it took me so many years to discover the utter joy of cooking with cast iron - I have gotten rid of all my other pans.\\nCast iron has changed my life and my cooking habits - and the Lodge pans are a wonderful quality.\\nI have used my new lodge skillet a couple of times and so far love it!\\nThe Lodge company manufactures cookware which is non-stick, NO chemical coating, pre-seasoned, *MADE IN THE USA*.\\nEasy to clean...hot water (no soap), plastic brush & dry very well.\\nThis 15\" skillet easily fit 12 chicken thighs, browned and then baked with lots of vegetables and sauce.\\nPlan to gradually transition to all Lodge cookware, for reasons of excellent quality & value, safe & healthy cooking...and buying American-Made.\\nI love this Cast Iron Skillet!\\nI love this Cast Iron Skillet!\\nWhen done washing with hot water (I make sure I use rubber gloves, so you don\\'t get burn!) I dry it with a dish cloth or paper towels and spray some Pam on it, butter flavor!\\nI love my Lodge Cast Iron cookware.\\nSome of it is more than forty years old, and still going strong.The 4 star rating is for the write-up.When I needed a 12-inch cooking surface for adapting some recipes to cast iron, I had a D\\'oh Moment.\\nThe cooking surface is considerably smaller.I\\'d like to see more information in the Product Details.And, I\\'ll be buying the 15-inch skillet.\\n&lt;sigh> I grew up using cast iron skillets and my family members all have them so I suddenly realized it was weird that I\\'d never bought one for myself!\\n(I think I\\'ve been using my enamel dutch oven for a lot of things.)  This one said it came pre-seasoned which meant something different than I was envisioning.\\nMy family\\'s old seasoned skillet has a tight, smooth surface that we maintain with oil so that\\'s what I imagined it would be like but it is actually sort of bumpy on its surface which is strange to me.\\nAnyway, it cooks just fine so it\\'s all good but yeah, not quite like ma\\'s.\\nB/c the pan is so large, the heat distribution doesn\\'t work well on a normal stove, so it gets really hot in the center but not enough heat on the side.\\nI have always liked Lodge cast iron.\\nThere are some cooking tasks that even our pricey All-Clad cookware can\\'t do as well as cast iron can.\\nThis is good for fitting the skillet in the oven or inside the bbq grill cover, but not good for leverage to lift the pan.\\nThe iron skillet is what your grandparents and their parents cooked with every day.Technology has yet to duplicate the results obtained from this simple and inexpensive item.\\nNo other cookware can do eggs on the range, fried chicken on the BBQ grill, fajitas on an open pit fire and bake a potatoe casserole in the oven.The perfect gift for young families just getting started.\\nEspecially non-enameled cast iron.\\nFirst and foremost, yes the IRON quality is a little lower than 25 -100 years ago.\\nSo let\\'s accept this fact and move on.The pan is good for egg frying, sautes, veggie sears, and CORNBREAD.\\nThe prices with PRIME SHIPPING is excellent.My pan arrived in Mint condition.PLEASE RE-SEASON before use, and take care of this pan, as ALL CAST IRON.\\nAgain the 1-star gang, are all newbies and not skilled with using CAST IRON, so their reviews are based on their ignorance.\\nSo ignore THEM.Here is my tip, and please follow, and you will fall in love with CAST IRON, and I hope you buy the 2 next sizes up, and pass this down to your children and grandchildren, because YES, Lodge  with proper care, should last your lifetime, and a couple more.LOLITA\\'S LODGE CARE TIP:I think this skillet is fine, if you season it yourself with VEGETABLE SHORTENING.\\nThen let final cool down, and wash with rag, a a little dish soap, OR USE A MILD SCRUB BRUSH ( NYLON, NOT COPPER) ( no scrubbing, or immersion), just simple sink wash, and NEVER  put CAST IRON, that is NOT enameled, in dishwasher.\\nJust needs a little more care than our Grandma\\'s Lodge.AND PLEASE DRY IMMEDIATELY, WITH A TOWEL.\\nAll cast iron hates to sit in water.\\nCombined with glass lid (Amazon suggested lid making my getting a good fit an easy process), this produces consitand results on foods that I would otherwise grill.\\nBut this pan and lid produces awesome results after enduring the several minutes it takes for the burner to heat up.\\nAs necessary, add about teaspoon of olive oil or equvilent to pan and rub into pan surface with paper towel (clean rag would be better) in order to keep pan &#34;seasoned&#34;.\\nMy friend had talked about wanting a cast iron pan for ages and she was thrilled when she opened the box.\\nThe Lodge LMS3 Mini Skillet (3.5&#34;) is perfect for one egg.\\nMy husband prefers his breakfast sandwich NOT have egg hanging over the edges of the english muffin (silly, I know, but it\\'s the truth) and this pan makes the perfectly sized egg.\\nI allow it to cook a bit more than usual on the first side so it stays together when flipped with a mini spatula and voila, a perfectly sized fried egg for one perfectly sized egg sandwich.It is supposed to arrive pre-seasoned, but like all cast iron cookware, it works best now that I\\'ve seasoned it myself.\\nAlso like all cast iron cookware, it WILL rust if left wet.\\nBest to simply wipe out the skillet after each use and if you feel you MUST wash it, best to dry it immediately.Cheers!=^..^= I can\\'t say enough good things about the pre-seasoned cast iron.\\nIt is especially helpful to people who are new to using cast iron.\\nOnce you get used to using cast iron and find out how it retains heat and cooks great, you will love it.\\nIf necessary use a brush to loosen anything left on the pan, rinse with hot water (do NOT use soap)and dry.\\nWhile the pan is still warm from the hot water, smooth a thin layer of shortening over it and wipe off excess with a paper towel.\\nIf you are cooking for less than four people, buy the smaller size skillet.\\nFrom the internet research and googling information on cast iron skillets, I have decided that the Lodge Logic brand was best for us for these reasons:1: Made in USA2: Price3: Quality4.\\nAlton Brown uses Lodge cast iron products5.\\nPre-seasonedAccording to the enclosed label that accompanied this product, that use of oil may be necessary for the first couple of times to prevent food from sticking.\\nFood did stick once or twice in the beginning.However, after getting acclimated to this skillet it\\'s really easy cleaning it each and every time.\\nSometimes I just have to wipe it clean with a paper towel and sometimes I just use soap and water, wipe quickly and just &#34;season&#34; it for next time.\\nI am continuing to add more cast-iron products in my kitchen as I replace the teflon products.\\nThis is the bad boy of all bad boys.Deep enough to fry up fish/chicken/chops/etc, yet large enough for sausage, bacon, or eggs.It\\'s very well constructed, and will last a lifetime with proper cast iron care.The more you use it, the better things taste.\\nIf you want cast iron, you can\\'t go wrong with this skillet.\\nPerfect size for cooking for one - use the 10\" for two.\\nNote that glue from the label leaves a slight discoloration on the skillet - probably nothing, but I cooked it quite a few times to scrub it out.\\nThese pans for forgiving because the thick and heavy size, which evens out the heat.\\nI can\\'t understand why people would pay so much money for Teflon-coated pans when seasoned cast iron cookwares are just as non-sticking and are so much less expensive.\\nSome foods must be cooked in a heavy pan that tempers and retains heat, for those foods Lodge offers this 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet.\\nThough it must be hand washed, dried and oiled, this frying pan is an integral part of my cooking routine and is definately worth the extra care.\\nI seasoned the pan with a paper towel dampened with cooking oil, and my morning omelets don\\'t stick.\\nI re-season the pan after 4-5 washings to maintain the patina.\\nI love to cook and I bought this for certain recipes and it is really wonderful.\\nHe can have one of his favourite dishes which I could not cook because the skillet we had disappeared when we movedSo  it will last forever .\\nThe trick to cast iron skillets is to get them hot before cooking.\\nNot to mention that you get added iron by just cooking in them.\\nPlus, the ritual of cleaning with a brush, which just takes a minute and can be done without even wetting your hands, becomes rather pleasant.One bit of advice: the first few times you use, be generous with the oil.\\nAll you need is a film that covers all the surface--add a bit if the food absorbs it while cooking.\\nThis way you avoid food getting stuck on the surface and causing problems with the seasoning.\\nTHe more you use it, the better it becomes.Perfect size for two fried eggs!\\nHowever, I had none in this size range; ordered the Lodge Logic skillet based on reviews and I am not disappointed.\\nThis was my first experience with a Lodge pre-seasoned skillet, and having read some reviews of the Lodge pre-seasoned finish, I wasn\\'t certain I would like it.\\nIt is true that the finish of these pans is not mirror-smooth like the perfectly seasoned and maintained cast iron pans of yesteryear, but that is mainly an aesthetic difference, not a practical one.\\nThe surfaces of both are nearly non-stick, and the evenness of the temperature, heat-retention, and durability make them far preferable to teflon-coated non-stick pans.\\nFor searing of meat and other high-temperature cooking, there is nothing that can compare to cast iron.\\nThis size is perfect for so many uses; its quality and durability make it a bargain.\\nI\\'ve used Calphalon and other anodized aluminum pans, Le Creuset and other enameled pans, non-stick pans of all sorts, copper, stainless steel, and on and on, and there is nothing that can surpass a properly seasoned cast iron pan.\\nI\\'m using this pan a lot instead of using the microwave or oven to reheat things.\\nVery useful  Makes great grilled cheese sanwiches.\\nEvenly sautes onions in prep for making other dishes I love my Lodge skillet.\\nI have a 12\" cast iron skillet and was looking for one a couple of inches larger.\\nThis seemed to be what I wanted, but when it arrived I found it to be a slant-sided skillet with a cooking surface of the same old 12\" I have.\\nI\\'ve used this skillet many times and have to re-season it after every use, and I followed instructions when it arrived.\\nI have a pre-seasoned biscuit pan that has held its seasoning with no problem, so I\\'m mostly disappointed in this skillet.\\nthis is a great pan, but beware, it is really heavy!\\nIt\\'s heavy (but not too heavy since it\\'s just a 9&#34; pan), retains heat perfectly and is pre-seasoned.\\nI also got the hot pad handle which I think is mandatory (otherwise you might just reach out to move the hot pan and get burned).\\nIts an iron skillet, and its was such an affordable expense!\\nGreat product, took a while to convince my wife to get into cast iron cooking however now that she is on board we will be switching to all cast iron.\\nStop buying lousy and potentially dangerous pots and pans from China and get yourself some genuine made in America cast iron.\\nBut keep them dry with a light coating of vegetable oil ( olive oil works great ) and its better than teflon.\\nThe preseasoning worked well and you should treat the pan properly to keep the seasoning \"healthy.\"  The 10 1/4 inch is a good size for many things and fits well on a large burner.\\nKeep in mind if you go bigger the pan will be that much heavier.I use the pan for making Swedish pancakes, and cast iron is the only type of pan you will find an authentic Swedish pancake cooking in.\\nMuch thinner than the traditional pancake.The only thing I don\\'t like about the pan is that it didn\\'t come with a handle insulator.\\nI know this is a per-seasoned pan, but I figured the factory coating would be a bit \"mass-produced\" at best, so added a coat of my own before using it.\\nI\\'ve used it for bacon and eggs, pancakes, and a chili like dish, as well as for frying some fries in vegetable oil, which really seemed to improve the coating.\\nThe pan is great, very good quality and very heavy.\\nbut it seems good and sturdy for a cast iron.\\nmake sure to read up on how to care for cast iron pans if you are new to the material.\\nthey can not be used like regular pans I love ourLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet!\\nFor us, it is an essential piece of equipment.TheLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet, a classic skillet, belongs in many kitchens.\\nIt is wise to buy theLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Cast-Iron Lidwith it to make cooking in a skillet safe and to increase the verstility of this skillet.We have used our skillet extensively, especially in recipe development for Flavored with Love: Mary Lou\\'s Family and Friends Can Cook and The Collard Patch.\\nHere is another cornbread recipe  developed with our Lodge skillet:Butter Pecan CornbreadIngredients1 stick ( pound) unsalted butter1 cup chopped pecans1 tablespoon canola oil1 cups self-rising cornmeal mix1 cup self-rising flour teaspoon baking powder1 cup milk3 eggs, beaten2 tablespoons honeyPreparation--In a small saucepan melt the butter with the pecans in it.\\nHeat the skillet with the oil in it.--Combine the dry ingredients.--Add the remaining ingredients.--Spoon the batter into the hot skillet.--Bake 10-12 minutes.One of the problems people seem to have with the skillet is sticking.\\nSince I use it to cook cornbread, I usually heat the oil in it in the oven and pour the warmed oil into the cornbread batter immediately before pouring it into the skillet.\\nI have sprayed it generously with Pam(PAM-Original No Stick Cooking Spray, 3/8oz Cans) to cook other foods and had great results.Every meal we cook would present some opportunity to use the iron skillet, but we don\\'t use it every day because we have become leery of cooking a large amount of our food in iron.\\nWe are trying to protect our heart health, and there has been much concern lately about cooking in iron pots and pans.\\n(Another more sinister but rare risk is possible damage to the liver.)  We don\\'t allow these warnings to keep us from using our skillet to make our favorite cornbreads, to cook steaks effortlessly with great results, to broil salmon, to cook fajitas, and to saute onions.\\nI am loving my cast iron.\\nI am loving my cast iron.\\nI just washit as soon as it cools in hot water, dry it, andspray it with oil so its ready to go when neededkeeping it non-stick.\\nThis pan might infuriate you for the first couple of weeks you have it (even if you season it on your own) but once you get a nice coating on there it becomes a great everyday pan.\\nA nice coat of oil every few weeks keeps it looking and working like a vintage cast iron pan at a quarter of the price.\\nLove it...this is my favorite pan.I had one in a different size for years.Bought this larger one and it is just as great.Very heavy, heats evenly, cooks everything great.Good deal on amazon.BONUS it is made here in the USA.Highly recommend this...you will have it for the rest of your life.\\nSecondly, the interior of the pan is WAY too rough to be truly non-stick.\\nThe idea of non-stick cast iron comes from the interior finish being smooth and seasoned.\\nI took the roughness down with 120 grit then 220 grit sandpaper, then seasoned it twice, and now it\\'s easy to use and works well.\\nBut this took me over two hours to sand alone.In the end, I\\'d opt for a vintage, turn of the century pan like a Wagner on eBay...you\\'ll pay a bit more for it, but it will be truly non-stick, and you\\'ll most likely be eating off a pan that cooked a meal for some burly pioneer dude.\\nIt\\'s huge, and, well, how much is there to say about a chunk of iron that you heat up and cook stuff in.\\nI assume anyone reading this review has already read up on the cooking properties of iron, yadda yadda yadda, so I won\\'t bother.\\nI looked at a 10\" skillet in a department store that was $40, made in Malaysia, not pre seasoned and appeared to have been made in a garage.\\nHuge and heavy, this pan heats evenly and holds lots of food, which is the reason I bought it.\\nour standard 10&#34; cast iron skillet just doesn\\'t hold enough to feed the kids anymore.\\nIn a recent move I somehow managed to misplace my grandmothers old cast iron pan.\\nI\\'m not sure why but 10\" of cast iron just looks small.\\nI am a complete cast-iron convert and own about 7-8 main cooking pieces.\\nSize is a major issue when deciding on a pan--This is the right pan for:--Side dishes for a family--Main dishes for a single person--cornbreadThis is not the right size for you:--if you have a very large family and want to make sides/main dishes in itAs with all lodge products, this is well made and, with the right care, will last more than a lifetime.\\nI own one non-lodge cast iron skillet and it has developed a hairline crack in it.\\nI use a second, pre-heated pot at a lower temperature.This pot is everything a cast iron pan should be.\\nThe final state of matter, even stars*, has to be good as cookware.*In case you didn\\'t know, once any star has burned up all its other material and starts to make iron, it\\'s headed for nova -- death.\\nI bought my first cast iron piece last year...an enameled dutch oven from Ledge and I love it.\\nI\\'ve always wanted un-coated cast iron though just to try it.\\nI am so excited to use this pan.\\nI grew up on a cast-iron pan house, and cooked a lot of moosemeat in one.\\nIn fact, I can put a 3-egg and cheese mix in the pan, let it set on a medium burner for a few minutes, put the stainless steel/walnut spatula (sold on Amazon) under it, flip it intact, turn off the heat, then just flip the pan over and drop it out onto a plate.\\nThen rub a little vegetable oil on it, and put it into the oven and let it reside there the next time you bake.\\nOR just heat it on the burner and let it smoke.BIG TIP FOR CAST IRON AND STAINLESS PANS: Let them heat up BEFORE you add any cooking oil as you first start to cook.\\nIf you add things to a cold pan, they will very likely give you problems.\\nIt wasn\\'t until the last few years that I discovered the joys of cooking with cast iron - both with Le Creuset enameled cookware and this fabulous Lodge Logic cast iron.I use cast iron to cook nearly everything - It\\'s heat retention and even cooking is superior to everything - including stainless steel - I have a few stainless steel pots, as well as cast aluminum - and nothing beat cast iron.This skillet, in my mind, is a must-have for any kitchen.\\nAnything you could use a skillet or frying pan for, you can use this.\\nSear it on the stove top and throw it in the oven for a quick broil - do it all in this pan.Best of all - the cheapest pan I own is the one that I use the most and will last me forever...Get this pan, you won\\'t regret it!!\\nSuch a great investment.A lot of the 1-star reviews seem to be related to people not knowing how to properly care for the cast iron or cook with it.\\nIf you\\'re not familiar with it, it\\'s totally different than your standard stainless or non-stick cookware.Being a nerd, I did a lot of research before I invested in cast iron and am glad I did.\\nDon\\'t be fooled by the idea of this pan being pre-seasoned; you\\'ll need to put in some upfront work to get good results.\\nIf you do, you can expect it to last for year, decades even.Google Sheryl Canter and Chemistry of Cast Iron; I followed this method and had no issues with food sticking from the very first use, cornbread mind you.I also recommend investing in some steel wool, coarse salt, and a sturdy brush (I use bamboo).\\nThe steel wool is good if your pan rusts, the salt is great for cleaning residue and the bamboo brush is excellent for tough stuck on food debris.\\nMy only other piece of advice is to let the pan cool before getting it wet to clean it.I would definitely by more Lodge products, this one doesn\\'t disappoint.\\nI\\'m having a devil of a time getting pancakes to cook evenly.\\nFirst the delivery was prompt..thank you Amazon..Being an iron skillet, it is heavy..but with the extra loop, it makes it easier to move, etc..\\nThey say no soap, and I have a 12 inch that looks like new....I use a scotchbrite scrub sponge to wash it in dawn, and rinse it really, really well...then put it on the stove and heat the pan to hot...turn off burner, and pore a little vegetable oil in the pan, and take a paper towel and make sure you cover bottom and inside sides with this oil.\\nJust let it sit on stove till has cooled...it is again pre-seasoned and ready for use.\\nThe heat completely dries the pan out, to prevent rust...and it keeps the pan looking like new.Once you have tasted fried chicken done in a iron pan with \\'shortening\\' not oil....you will never use anything else to cook chicken, except maybe a deep frier...I LOVE IT!\\nIf you\\'re into cast iron cooking, this brutal hunk of metal will do the job with no apologies.\\nIf this skillet was a person he would be a lumberjack and your steak and eggs would taste like when you go camping and you cook breakfast over the fire.\\nIf you\\'re at all curious about cast iron cooking then this is a no brainer.Heavy enough to use as a weapon in the event a burglar breaks in to steal your steak and eggs.\\nI have several cast-iron products including a wok, grill pan and a couple of Dutch ovens.\\nI have a full set of All Clad stainless frying pans that are somewhat non-stick if you know how to use them.\\nI\\'ve heard so much about Grandma\\'s priceless iron frying pan that I had to give it a try.\\nI guess I\\'ll get used to these problems and learn to appreciate the ultimate cooking surface that iron provides.\\nEvery size of pan requires some amount stirring because of hot spots.\\nThe cast iron held its heat very well.\\nThey turned out great, and everyone was served hot hash browns at the same time!\\nIf you are still unsure, then just opt for the 12 inch cast iron pan.\\nIt is exactly what it is suppose to be...a huge, heavy, cast iron skillet that is great for large meals.\\nThat is the time when you contact Amazon customer service, not by giving a product 4 stars.When you buy Cast Iron you are buying a piece of history and with that comes a time investment into the maintenance of your kitchen tools.\\nI enjoy caring for my cast iron and enjoy learning how to.\\nDo your home work and read some Cast Iron blogs.\\nI already own a 12-inch Lodge Logic pre-seasoned cast-iron skillet but always found it too large for a lot of applications, too heavy, and too slow to heat up properly.\\nThis 8-inch skillet is perfect for making individual omelettes or cooking up smaller batches of vegetables, potatoes, etc.\\nSince the 8-inch diameter refers to the lip of the pan, the actual cooking surface is smaller than 8-inches so I can\\'t imagine getting the 6 1/2-inch skillet for anything other than a novelty item.On one last note, the pre-seasoning is actually not too bad and I was able to make some great eggs on my first use without them sticking.\\nEveryone here has their different way of cleaning cast-iron so I\\'ll add mine: after cooking and when the pan is still hot/warm, sprinkle in about 1Tbsp of kosher salt and rub this around the pan with a paper towel to scrape away any thing that\\'s left in the pan.\\nDump out the salt (careful, it\\'ll be hot) into the sink/trash, then add a little bit of cooking oil to the pan and spread it around using the same piece of paper towel.\\nI almost never wash my pans, unless there\\'s a sauce cooking in it (which I try to avoid, use stainless steel instead for tomato sauces).\\nThis little skillet is fantastic, as you would expect from Lodge.\\nI mostly use this for hot dips - keeps the dip warm for at least an hour without cords or flame - awesome for Game Day - by the time it\\'s cool, the dip is gone.\\nAlso perfect for cooking a couple of eggs, but beyond fairly single-serve cooking, this skillet is a bit too small to be a work-horse.I Also have the 8 inch skillet, and that size is a bit more versatile - large enough to grill a sandwich or a couple of chicken breasts.\\nThe pan can even be put in our oven for when he wants to make a fritata or cornbread.\\nHe feels confident that I bought a pan that could be used in another 80 years.There is no insulating handle, so make sure you have potholders or oven mitts - the pan gets hot and retains the heat for a while.\\nAlso, be sure to follow the care instructions: this pan needs to be seasoned after use.\\nVery different from the other stuff you use daily, but this heats fast and hold very even heat to whatever your cooking.\\nThere is simply no better pan for certain uses than a genuine American cast iron skillet.\\nLove this pan and use it all the time.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use cast iron, check it out and then buy this pan!\\nSo, this was the first Cast-Iron Pan I bought, It did everything so well from day one, that I had to add the Lid - do not buy this without the lid.\\nNow, I still use by Anodized pans too, but when I work with heavy meats and juices, the cast iron is the beast.\\nI love my Lodge cast iron skillet.\\nI love my Lodge cast iron skillet.\\nJust be sure to take good care of it and always coat it with oil after you clean it so it doesn\\'t rust!\\nMy mom had a 12\" cast iron frying pan that she constantly used when I was growing up.\\nDespite the grossness the food always came out great so I didn\\'t complain.This lodge pan seems like a mini version of my mom\\'s.\\n;-)The pan is just about perfect for cooking for one or making a side dish.\\nNever use soap, wipe out the grease and then wash in hot water.\\nPut about a teaspoon of cooking oil on a paper towel and rub the oil all over the pan after you towel dry it.6.\\nCast iron should work on most cook tops, even induction.9.\\nAfter reading all the glowing posts about seasoned cast iron, you\\'d wonder why anyone was ever persuaded to buy that nasty Teflon stuff when they already owned (back in the 50s and 60s) the  perfect non-stick pan.\\nWell I bought this pan and it hasn\\'t been that great for me.\\nFrom reading on the web, apparently until the 70s cast iron skillets were machined inside to a smooth finish, but the interior these days is left pretty much the way it comes out of the iron casting.\\nI\\'ve tried seasoning the pan in the oven with the techniques you can read about on the web, in Alton Brown\\'s books, etc and nothing has given me a smooth slick surface on the bottom.\\nI guess I thought that that ranges for home use just weren\\'t hot enough to get restaurant quality food.\\nI don\\'t think enough people know how good cast iron is to cook with and settle for substandard cookware like I did.This pan is heavy and pretty much indestructible, unlike non-stick pans that have limited useful lives.\\nThough it comes pre-seasoned, before using it, I washed it and baked it at 200 degrees for 2 hours after spreading Crisco on it (lard is supposed to be even better for this).\\nAfter this, it is 99% stick-free and the seasoning will just get better with time.\\nThe cast iron retains heat much better than steel or aluminum and spreads heat more evenly, which provides superior results, even when using a lower flame.\\nThis pan (or any Lodge product) is an excellent value and something every household should have.Since I got this pan, however, I learned about the advantages of buying second hand cast iron such as Griswold or Wagner, made from the 1850s to the 1950s, and I picked up a couple myself.\\nThese pans are superior to modern Lodge pans (or any other current cast iron ware), but they will also be a bit more expensive (approx $50-$60 for an 11\" pan online) and usually need to be restored and re-seasoned, which requires some elbow grease.\\nIn my experience, the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface doesn\\'t significantly impair its non-stick properties, but the smooth surface of my antique pans is far superior and much nicer to cook on.\\nWith the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface, it\\'s not as easy to smoothly slide a stainless steel spatula under foods and it\\'s noisier, whereas with the old pans, a spatula glides effortlessly under foods.\\nLike many things, cast iron cookware with the quality of the old days just isn\\'t being made anymore and will likely never be again.For price, performance and easy availability, however, I don\\'t think anything beats Lodge.\\nConverted all our cookware over from a non-stick to Lodge and Le Creuset pots and pans.\\nThe Lodge pan works great for almost all tasks.\\nThe cast iron excels at all frying, and high temperature cooking.\\nI use another enameled pan for cooking liquidy foods so as to best preserve the nonstick seasoning of the Lodge cast iron.\\nLearn how to maintain this pan (oil after every use, don\\'t wash with soap only hot water, etc.) it will give you great non-stick performance.\\nI have also heard of additional benefit of these pans adding iron to your diet.\\nAs I have been switching over to all cast iron cookware, I have purchased products from several manufacturers.\\nLodge is simply the best I have found.The skillet is smooth and well balanced.\\nThis time I used the pan with only a simple cleaning.\\nWell, I, for one, wish they made more different styles so I could stick to their product line alone.The Lodge stuff costs a bit more, but it is worth it.\\n**** UPDATE 2 ****I\\'m still learning how to use this wonderful pan.\\nI use Pam spray (not the old kind that leaves a residue), butter or olive oil while cooking, wipe it out with dry and wet paper towels immediately after removing the food, and recoat with spray and leave it on the burner to cool.\\nIn most cases I can clean the pan so quickly my food is still hot when I sit down to eat.I now use it about as often as my nonstick skillet, although it\\'s horses for courses.If you broil steaks indoors in winter, try this: Lay some foil in the pan and shape it to fit.\\nHeat the pan on the burner until the oil starts to smoke.\\nFor example, at breakfast you can cook eggs, hash browns and bacon at the same time.\\nIf you are diligent about keeping it well-oiled and don\\'t put food in until it\\'s pre-heated, the pan behaves as if it were non-stick.I wish the main handle was longer.\\nThe pan is so heavy it\\'s hard to move around when cleaning.\\nI pretty much have to leave it on the stove and wipe it out with a bunch of wet paper towels.ORIGINAL REVIEWI bought this after getting frustrated trying to cook sea scallops in a regular pan and not getting a good sear.\\nThis is the kind of pan you need for searing meats on a stove or in an oven.It\\'s got a rough texture finish inside.\\nBe sure it\\'s hot and has oil or butter on it before adding food to prevent sticking.\\nIf you clean it with soap you need to heat it and rub oil on it to restore the seasoning coat that prevents the food from welding onto it.It\\'s really heavy!\\nIf the pan is warm (and it stays warm long after you turn off the burner) you\\'ll need potholders on both hands to move it to the sink for soaking or cleaning.I\\'m still experimenting with it, but I think it makes a great addition to the kitchen.\\nI use it much less often than my non-stick Circulon skillet, but it lets me do things I never could before and that\\'s sparking my creative juices.\\nI like being able to put it in the oven as well as use it on the stove top.My only complaint is that it is extremely heavy.\\nI am anemic, so I am using this skillet to put some extra iron into my system.\\nWhen you cook eggs in it, you have to make sure that it is very oil or the eggs will stick.\\n15 inches is a lot of frying pan.\\nThis pan came ready-to-use, pre-seasoned as advertised.\\nThis lodge skillets work great when cooking meats.\\nI usually brown on the stove-top and then put in the oven to finish cooking.\\nI use this when I cook vegetable stir-fry.\\nI am not an expert or an Iron Chef but my kitchen will always have a skillet.\\nI use the 12 inch for meats and vegetables and the 8 inch for cooking cornbread.\\nGranted, I\\'m a newbie to cast iron, but I wanted to go that route especially for steaks and burgers cooked indoors.\\nI was impressed with the size and weight but I must be doing something wrong because I\\'ve never successfully cooked eggs in it without getting them stuck to the bottom of the pan (even with adding oil each time).\\nCost was about the same just had to pay for tax, so like ~$3 more.Wanted to smooth the cooking surface a bit more, this what I did:First used 150 grit sandpaper and finished with 400 grit wet sandpaper.\\nOne can sand even more[mirror like finish], but this was enough for the skillets bought and not really necessary.Wash well with soap and a scouring pad or similar.\\nRinse/Dry immediately and throughly, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillets.Then re-season the skillets.\\nFor 1 hour, let it cool down for ~30 minutes and repeat the re-seasoning process 3-5 times to get them well seasoned again.First time use was great.\\nThe eggs did stick a little, but that is to be expected; as more seasoning/cooking is done that will be a thing of the past.For cleaning one can use a scrub brush as suggested or salt.\\nCleaning with salt works great, got the idea from [0].[0] http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKIOBGJ0W2M3/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&asin;=B0002F9AH2&cdForum;=Fx3EC6KN3NF72WV&cdMsgID;=Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6&cdMsgNo;=1&cdPage;=1&cdSort;=oldest&cdThread;=Tx36UJEPNPG0XE7&store;=home-garden#Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6Basically just pour some salt on the skillet and rub a bit[not hard, just enough to remove any stuck bits] with a paper towel.Rinse well with water [if skillet is warm/hot; use hot water], over the surface of the skillet.\\nDry immediately with paper/cloth towel throughly; place back on the stove/oven to fully dry, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillet while still warm/hot.Put away in a cool dry place with a paper towel over the skillet cooking surface to prevent rust[which should not happen; just as a precaution].\\nLodge pre seasoned is the way to go.\\nthis was part of a cast-iron buying frenzy i went through recently.\\nI bought this skillet thinking that it was a larger size (just an FYI, size 6 back in the day was actually an 8 inch pan.\\nI didn\\'t want to ship it back since it was my own stupid fault and I\\'m a great believer that there is no such thing as useless cast iron.I use this pan mainly for making eggs in the morning or a two person portion of cornbread.\\nIt is great for those who worry about the tough clean up involved in new cast iron.\\nThis skillet is light and a breeze to clean.I have found that all of my Lodge cookware is versatile and very durable and easy to clean.\\nCheap, healthy (you get some extra iron!), works really well, multifunctional (you can use it as a weapon, because it is very heavy of course).\\nI recommend it as a staple pan for every serious cooking.\\nI have been looking for another good iron skillet for a while, not findin anything in the stores that i like.\\nI seem to always find things on Amazon i can find anywhere else.the skillet is great heavy and already seasoned - only thing i wish it was a little bigger.Other than that a great skillet for everyday stove top and oven use.\\nServed me well for the last 2 months...bit too heavy for people with arthritis or spondylosis..think twice...cooks great...browns beautifully...be careful to follow the instructions and it will last u long.\\nI didn\\'t realize just how large this pan would be but it\\'s a big skillet!\\nIdeal for large families and those who cook for an army like myself :) Really nice quality....AND how can you beat free shipping with this?!\\nLike one of the other reviewers, I initially tried it out with eggs, right after receiving it...definitely stuck to the pan.\\nI started to cook all my greasy food in this pan, and after about a month, it improved significantly!\\nToday, I fried eggs with only a little cooking oil (same conditions as with my teflon frying pan), and to my surprise, the eggs didn\\'t stick!\\nI\\'m VERY happy I bought this, and will continue to use this for a long time.\\nCleaning is actually not so bad, I scrub it out under hot water, then put it back on the stove, heat it to dry, then coat with oil.\\nThanks to all the reviewers and their input, which helped me to decide to go cast iron!\\nIt bubbles up & when the water settles down, I pour it out & nothing is left sticking to the pan, although I still use the Lodge Logic cast iron brush on it while under hot running water.\\nEverything taste better when it\\'s cooked in seaoned cast iron & this brand is durable & you have many sizes to choose from.\\nPros:It heats very evenly and cooks better than any cookware I have owned.\\nThe seasoning and patina it develops provides a natural non-stick coating.\\nTwo hand hold required.Tips:You must have goot pot holders, as the uninsulated handles will get hot when cooking.Don\\'t scrub hard as it removes the seasoning.Don\\'t let it air dry, it will rust.Don\\'t put it in the dishwasher, as it will remove the seasoning.Leave it a little oily after you cook I use on gas stove and out door grill.\\nclean up couldn\\'t be easier.hot water, brush and a slight coat of vegtable oil I was happy to finally find these 6 1/2 in.\\nMy kitchen couldn\\'t operate without my cast iron cookware.\\n(After a mix-up with the shipping company, I found my order and all turned out well.) LOVE AMAZON, you\\'re my store!Rita McWhorter I\\'ve loved this pan from the moment I seasoned it, and have used it several times a week since.\\nThe 10.25-inch is a perfect size for the 2 of us, and allows you to pretty easily cook up a couple thick, 10oz steaks (or so).\\nSome days I wish I had a 12&#34;, when we have company over, but this size is perfect for 2-3 people for most dishes.The cast iron requires a bit different attention than a &#34;standard&#34; pan, but I\\'ve found it definitely to be worth it and it\\'s just about developing new habits.\\nI like to have one iron skillet in my pots and pans collection.\\nI use it for frying bacon and for making corn bread.\\nIts heavy, its heats really fast and it comes pre-seasoned.\\nI especially appreciate these small cast iron skillets by lodge.\\nI don\\'t have to bother with a large skillet, clean up, etc, when wanting to cook or reheat a small amount.\\nI bought this because a good friend who was visiting put my 100+ yr old skillet in the dishwasher.\\nYes, I cried & it was all I could do not to wring her neck.I love this skillet now, but straight from the store the preseason was worthless.I have the fancy corn bread pans and their large reversible griddle.\\nThese items came seasoned and none worked like that antique pan I thought was ruined.Another friend asked me to her camp house and she said bring all your cast iron you want to season, because you\\'ll be doing mine as well.This is what I did.Scrubbed all of it using Dawn.Dried it with flour sack towels, I buy from Sam\\'s Club.Put all the cookware on the campfire so it was definitely dry.Pulled out of the campfire, waited for it to cool enough to handle.Grabbed my bucket of lard, yes I said lard.\\nStarted the process over again.Once I felt the insides were right, I flipped every thing over and started the process again.It did take most of the day, but I saved my 100+ yr old skillet.If you can\\'t get to a campfire, a gas or wood burning grill will do it as well, as long as it has a lid.If you don\\'t like the idea of lard, a good friend uses shortening.\\nI use lard because I\\'m 4th generation using my antique skillet.\\nI guarantee they didn\\'t have vegetable shortening.I do not recommend the cactus cornbread stick pan.\\nIt doesn\\'t heat evenly and it\\'s a pain to clean.If you get your cast iron seasoned properly, it will be heaven to use and last forever.\\nIf you feel the need to use soap and water definitely put in on a burner for a few minutes to make sure it\\'s dry and then use your vegetable oil of choice to smear it in every nook and cranny.Finally, spoke with a Lodge representative.\\nThey just don\\'t care.The customer service person I did speak with did say, even the Logic needs to be seasoned 3 to 5 times.She did tell me if you put it in your oven at 400F for 2 hours it will take off their stuff.\\nAfter you\\'ve used some steel wool and soap to wash it first.I think they do a huge disservice to the joy of using cast iron.\\nThis is a very high quality pan that makes great food.\\nTheir 12\" cast iron skillet is one of the most used items in my kitchen.\\nI quickly realized that for the about the same amount of money as a 14-15\" thin steel specialty paella pan, I could have this Lodge cast iron 15 1/4\" skillet, which is both more durable and more versatile.It\\'s proven to be good at paella on the grill, and is useful for cooking up a whole mess of zucchinis, or other large batches etc.\\nIt\\'s big enough that you can make two omelets side-by-side in the thing, (though making them individually in one of the smaller skillets is easier).Like all of the Lodge cast iron cookware, this is built to last and is very easy to use and maintain.\\nI use this more than any other pot/pan in my collection - it is THE BEST skillet for searing meats.\\nYes it\\'s heavy, but it\\'s freaking cast iron - what do you expect?\\nThat\\'s why there are 2 handles, and use mitts for both when the pan is hot.\\nI use salt to clean it, similar to this method, with a few tweaks:[...]Cast iron also produces the best cornbread, so I\\'ve used it for that as well.\\nI just bought a Lodge cast-iron grill pan as well, can\\'t wait to use it!\\nIt is made well, seasoned reasonably well, and I love that handle on the other side for lifting!\\nIt is so useful and so easy to cook with.\\nKeep this skillet properly seasoned, and it\\'ll be your new best friend.\\nI quickly learned that stainless steel is not the way to go unless you want to be best friends with Pam (the cooking spray) or if you use a lot of cooking oils (butter, grease, shortening) in your foods.\\nSo I bought more T-Fal, this time I purchased 2 non-stick skillets for my daily usage.\\nSuddenly I started finding little black chips in my eggs and the interior of the skillet had all kinds of scratches as the non-stick coating was peeling.\\nI decided to buy an iron skillet for the health benefits as well as the longevity of the cookware.\\nHow many grandmothers, mothers and aunt have a cast iron skillet from 20, 30, years ago?\\nit was all worth it.I cook pretty much everything in this skillet.\\nThe acid from the tomato just kills the nice non-stick loving I have going in this skillet.\\nBesides that its a perfect size for large and small meals.I\\'ve heard of different methods for cleaning and seasoning an iron skillet.\\nAs much as they say that this skillet is pre-seasoned, it is not non-stick yet.\\nEggs, baked chicken, fried foods, burgers, pretty much anything you can cook.\\nYou have to actually USE it.After I cook in it, I cleaned it with only HOT water and a really really tough nylon scrub brush.\\nThe soap with eat away at the non-stick layer you\\'re slowing building up.Either way, after you clean it, dry it completely with a towel.\\nPlace the skillet on the stove on high heat and use a small bit of shortening and very, very, lightly grease the interior of the skillet.\\nKeep it on the burner and let it heat up until you see the skillet begin to smoke.\\nTurn off the burner and let the skillet sit while it cools.Over time, using this method every time will get you that nice non-stick layer.\\nOf course, this layer is just shortening or cooking grease building up and baking into the skillet.3 years into this, I don\\'t have to season it like

wiped it down with some flax seed oil and put it into my heated oven and it fit with very little wiggle room.\\nIt certainly will not fit in my cabinets so it will have to live on my stove-top which

another fantastic bonus:\"Cooking with cast iron fortifies your food with iron.\\nWhile cast iron doesn\\'t leach chemicals, it can leach some iron into your food...and that\\'s a good thing.\\nCooking food, especially something acidic like tomato sauce in a cast-iron skillet can increase iron content, by as much as 20 times.\"SOURCE: [...] This pan is fantastic.\\nYes, cast iron is

in the USA!\\nWe needed (er, wanted) a bigger cast iron skillet, so we went looking for one with good reviews and landed here.\\nEverything was sticking a LOT, so I just seasoned it with shortening (Google if you don\\'t know how - very easy!), coating the whole pan (and putting a foil-covered cookie sheet below to catch drippings.\\nThe first few times, we made sure to cook fatty foods (bacon, ground beef), but now it is seasoned really well so we can just use a bit of spray and make anything - grilled cheese, french toast, veggies - whatever.\\nI have seasoned it a couple of times to get

for 10 minutes and then use a metal potscrubber brush, then wipe it with a paper towel and place it on a burner for 30 seconds to let any water evaporate.\\nThen very lightly coat it with oil.Also it best for the heat source to be under ALL the surface area of the bottom of the pan.\\nGo right ahead and use metal cooking utensils too.Lastly, for stovetop use, I love my skillet but not the cast

with a set of three regular cast iron pans from a different manufacturer, I finally boxed them up for Goodwill.\\nI never mastered the seasoning part of cast iron usage.\\nAfter about three attempts of scouring and reseasoning, I gave up and ordered three Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned skillets.It is fanstastic.\\nIt worked like a charm with the first use -- no problems with sticking at all.\\n(Acutally cast iron is the only way to make good cornbread.)

disappointed.\\nThese pans are clearly good quality heavy duty iron, and they are quite easy to cook with.\\nI was worried the 8&#34; would be a little small, but it has ended up being my go-to pan for a lot of things - the perfect size for heating up corn tortillas, frying side dishes, sauteeing veggies, etc.\\nThe 12&#34; I have used less since I generally am only cooking for one or two people, but it\\'s a nice size for a bigger batch of something if I were cooking for friends and family - would be great for making a big batch of home fries or something similar.\\nI have been cooking on cast iron for over 20 years.\\nFor those unfamiliar with cast iron, you simply dont know what your missing.\\nI only have 2 10\" skillets and I have wanted to buy some new pieces for quite some time.\\nIn particular, I have wanted to buy a 12\\' skillet, a dutch oven, and a griddle.\\nLodge cast iron could very well be the best deal going in the entire cookware market.\\nIts not that big of a deal as seasoning cast iron is very easy but I didn\\'t know if that was something I was going to have to do or not.\\nThe first thing I cooked was eggs and the flavor was just as good as my 20 year old pans, something I wasn\\'t expecting.For those new to cast iron, just remember a few simple rules and your pans should last forever.\\nNever use detergents or soap and always use hot water as rinsing a hot cast iron pan with cold water can actually cause your pans to crack.\\nFollow these rules and your pans will most likely outlast you.Bottom line - I am absolutely blown away by Lodge Cast Iron.\\nThe quality is amazing, the price is amazing and the pre-seasoned pans are literally ready to go right out of the box.\\nAgain cast iron has never been this easy.\\nAgain cast iron has never been this easy.\\nI will be recommending Lodge Cast Iron to everyone I know, right after I order a few more pans.5 Stars and then some!!!\\nThis is.the pan that does about 90% of the cooking in our house.\\nOnce you have it fully seasoned, it\\'s hard to get food to stick, which means super-easy cleanup!\\nI have a mid-range stainless steel multiclad type set that gets a little use, but this is my go-to pan for most cooking.Pros:Conducts heat well.Easy clean up.Can cook on all surfaces, including an open flame (campfire!)Cooks like a charm.Cons:Like all cast iron - no dishwasher!Handle gets hot.\\nIf you need one that the handle doesn\\'t get hot on, look at the newer ones with a stainless handle.Advice:No soap, wash gently in warm water, or you\\'ll remove the seasoning and stuff will stick.Wait to wash, if you try to wash it while it\\'s hot, you will most likely crack the iron.Reseason from time to time.Overall:A hundred years tells the story, your kids kids will be using this pan.\\nThe Lodge 8\" serving pot with iron lid is a wonderful compliment to this handy skillet.\\nMy grandparents had Lodge cast-iron cookware and loved it.\\nI purchased a few pieces from Amazon in mid-March.So far, the 8&#34; skillet has seen the most use.\\nI will NEVER buy anything but Lodge brand cast-iron when adding to my small collection.\\nI do have the 5 qt Dutch oven and look forward to fixing a pot roast in it using my gas grill during the summer.All of my &#34;other brand&#34; of cast-iron has been donated to a charity store.\\nI like Lodge cast iron items.\\nThis pan has become my 1st choice for browning or frying...distributes the heat evenly, excellently...i don\\'t have to turn the burner up as high either.\\nI love that its cast iron, us ladies need the extra iron in our diets & this is a good way to get the trace amounts in our diet.\\nGreat little pan for melting butter or cooking eggs.\\nIt\\'s the same great quality as the larger lodge skillets.\\nWe own several different sizes of Lodge Logic pans.\\nThe 12-Inch one is our favorite cast iron pan.\\nLodge cast iron, what a great thing.Properly seasoned and used its practically as no stick as teflon or hard anodized.\\nDont expect that overnight it takes multiple uses and seasonings to get it there but when its right and its there, in my opinion it cant be beat!And as for using soap as a no no...........Well that rule was created many moons ago when soap was lye based and yeah it would eat away at your seasoning.But as for a little modern dish DETERGENT (Not dishwasher, but dish) not a problem at all.I use it from time to time if the skillet needs a little help with cleanup and no problems at all.Just clean it up quick and dont let it sit on the iron and it will be fine.After all I really cant think of a health department that would appove a restraunt using the cast iron without cleaning it with detergent!!!!!And start out cooking on low temp and only go up as high as you need to as you learn your skillet.\\nThat will help with the initial sticking you may encounter and keep you from burning foods.Once you learn the skillet and how it cooks, higher temps will be fine!!\\nThere are many cast iron enthusiasts out there and I\\'m one of them.\\nExcept if you want to spend less time maintaining your skillet, I\\'d recommend a Le Creuset skillet (and not one from Martha Stewart because I believe those are all made in China and I try my best to avoid all food-related items to come from China).\\nEasy to clean, all the properties of cast iron except for the ridiculous price tag (just snag one when they\\'re on sale).\\npan- seared a WHOLE chicken oven roaster in this skillet yesterday and what a beautiful crust it gave that bird!!!\\nWe ate from it till we coldn\\'t eat no more!I anticipate cooking in this one everyday.This skillet is very generous and I did buy the lid for it, that\\'s another story/review..what another great peice to have after you season that big ol\\' lid(comes unseasoned).\\nHelper handle is a must cause it\\'s impossible to carry this skillet with one handle(very heavy alone so with food it weighs a ton!), be careful always to cover the handle after the iron gets hot...ouch!I gotta say I don\\'t know how the heck I was living without cast iron.\\nI threw all my non-stick out after all of them warped...and the crazy thing about it is that they were top-of-the-line...triple the cost of iron.\\nIf you want to do 2 at a time it gets a little bit more complicated to use.\\nEasy to clean If you want to cook a LOT at one time this is the pan for you.\\nWe wanted a big pan to fry large quantities of fish all at once.\\nWould definitely make sure you want a skillet this large.\\nLodge is a quality product, it is a life time product that does not have a chemical coated inside that will scratch when you use metal utensils.\\nLet\\'s start off with something that is not entirely clear from the description of this Lodge skillet on the Amazon website...\\nSome copy writer needs a new line of work...Next, some people may be trying to decide between Lodge and the Wagner Ware (WagnerWare - American Culinary Cookware) products.\\nYou will soon be cooking on a very fine skillet that, I can attest, does every bit as good a job as the Wagner Ware.\\nWe already have an older cast iron skillet that we use all the time, but I decided to buy a second in order to be able to use two at once.\\nWe can even use the silicon handle over on the other pan.\\nYou need both hands to handle this pan.\\nIgnore that this skillet is preseasoned, YouTube how to season and care for cast iron, and you\\'ll ultimately have a good heavy duty reasonably priced cast iron skillet that will last FOREVER.Cast Iron works better the more you use it.\\nMy older larger better used skillets work like this one \"should\" out of the box, but doesn\\'t.\\nI was cautious at first, but food really did not stick to the pre-seasoned finish.\\nAbout my fourth use I fried an egg which slipped right out of the pan when it was done.\\nBetter tasting food and easy clean-up, why did I desert cast iron for so many years for the false promises of fragile toxic teflon?The pan has the gritty texture some reviewers mentioned, but it does not affect performance.\\nMaybe soap is what spoiled my cooking experience in th past, leading me to give away my old skillets to my daughter-in-law.\\nStill, I give it a five because the heft also gives the pan its great cooking qualities.\\nWhen I do so I use this huge cast iron skillet that I got from my grandmother.\\nI like it because of the even heating and because it holds a pound of hamburger and \\'the box\\' additions.I\\'ve tried making casseroles in my other cookware, but unfortunately they\\'re not of high enough quality and inevitably one corner will burn while the others are fine.\\nI never have that problem with cast iron: it heats evenly.This large skillet is also great for cooking bacon and eggs, or for hamburgers.\\nMy skillet like this one has got to be 50 years old will no signs of wear and tear.\\nI had an old cast iron pan since college that I kept on my stove and used daily, cleaning the surface sparingly to avoid contact with water.\\nIt seemed perfect, but after a couple of months of use, it formed a crack this morning while I was cooking pancakes.\\nNothing extreme or unusual had been done to the pan; it hadn\\'t dropped, for example, just asked to cook at a medium heat.\\nThis is the end of my love for cast iron, at least for a while.\\nIf you want this pan, Amazon\\'s price is excellent.\\nIt is heavy and needs to be washed differently than our other pans, but the food prepared on it is like none other.\\nI use it every single day to cook for my large family.Can\\'t believe I \\'fell\\' for the teflon-type or anodized skillets; I was purchasing a new one every 2 or 3 years as they do not stand up to daily use.\\nThe one improvement we made to both our 15-1/4 and 10-1/4 inch Cast-iron Skillets was to subject them to some serious sanding with our orbital sander.\\nThe pan finish is now like glass and is 100% stick free!\\nI really like these Lodge Logic skillets, and this one is no exception.\\nIf you dont know, iron skillets distribute heat evenly along its surface.\\nThere arent hot spots like with aluminum and non stick skillets.\\nDefinitely note that these are NOT non stick skillets, but they are useful for a wide variety of things besides eggs.\\nFor example, we heat tortillas in ours, saute our vegetables, make skillet cakes, etc....additionally, they can go from the stovetop into the oven, so if you are, for example, pan frying a steak, you would sear one side, turn it over, then finish in the oven.\\nThis is useful for the abovementioned skillet cakes, corn bread, and a wide variety of other things.\\nYou are only limited by your imagination when it comes to these iron skillets.Enjoy!\\nObviously, it\\'s not an all clad copper core pan, but I would have expected pancakes to at least cook up more evenly than they did.\\nI have 2 pieces of Lodge cast iron cookware.\\nI have to add my voice to the chorus of cast iron admirers who don\\'t know how they ever survived without their Lodges.\\nSteaks, burgers, any type of sauteed chicken recipe, stir-fry, fajitas, cornbread, bacon and eggs, pancakes, french toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, and on and on.Cast iron\\'s chief strength comes from its massiveness.\\nIt is basically a honkin\\' big hunk of iron formed into a cooking utensil.\\nFuthermore, once properly conditioned (which Lodge has done for you here), they are almost as non-stick as teflon.Unfortunately, cast iron is not without its faults.\\nImagine trying to pick that up, plus the weight of whatever you\\'ve cooked in it, with one oven-mitted hand so that you can use a spoon in the other hand to help maneuver your recipe into a serving dish or storage container!\\nNo dishwasher, no soap (just hot water and a stiff brush), dry quickly and coat with cooking oil.I\\'ve read some reviews where folks are saying that you can\\'t cook tomato-based or acidic products in cast iron.\\nin my cast iron and haven\\'t seen any ill effects from doing so.These pans are so inexpensive, it will cost you very little to give them a try.\\nI deliberately waited to review this product, because there are so many reviews which praise or dismiss cast iron within a few days or weeks of them using it for the first time.\\nSo please take this review from someone who had the patience to experiment with the pros and the cons.Personally, I feel that cast iron, in general, is fantastic, because it will last for several life times if taken care of properly.\\nIn addition, it doesn\\'t have Teflon, which is becoming a constant concern for those who know better.Pros:It is durable for decades, if not centuries, IF CARED FOR PROPERLY.It distributes heat more evenly.It retains heat longer than other cookware.Once well seasoned, it almost takes care of itself.If you have a recipe that requires you to start the meal on the burner, then transfer it to the oven, this is perfect, since you don\\'t have to worry about some plastic or silicone handle grip melting in the oven.\\nPeople with arthritis, or some other physical impairment may have a problem with its weight.There is a learning curve, which takes some getting use to, because of the fact that it retains heat more evenly, and retains it.Un-learning how to clean your cookware can be counterintuitive.\\n(It removes the seasoning that makes cast iron so great and virtually nonstick.)The 10.25 inch skillet is deep enough, in my opinion, to be more of a pan, and not a skillet.\\nThis is the one item that I bought later than any of my other cast iron purchases, but it is the one pan that I use more than anything else.\\nRealistically, while the cast iron will probably outlive you, these cleaning brushes will get gunked up rather quickly.\\nYes, you\\'ll have to do some small amount of rethinking how you cook, but ultimately, anyone who is passionate about cooking will appreciate cast iron.\\nI\\'ve been looking for a small skillet that wasn\\'t coated with teflon for quite some time.\\nHere\\'s my take on this little gem:Pros:Just the right size for a single egg for breakfast or for cooking a small amount of onions or just about anything that would be too small in quantity to cover the bottom of an 8\" skillet.\\nCoat with olive oil after each use and you\\'re good to go.\\nThe problems with teflon are well known, but manufactures persist in using this toxic material to make pans non-stick.\\nDouble hooray!Cons:You\\'ve got to be a little more thoughtful about caring for this skillet than you are with the pans that are found in most grocery and big-box stores.\\nBut that care requires more thoughtfulness than a big investment of time.Conclusion:For small jobs, this is the pan.\\nI bought a 15&#34; skillet because of the $24 price at the time.\\nThese things are great for cooking 3-4 steaks at one time or a huge pan of onions/peppers/fried chicken.If you have a nice gas stove and feed 4+ people regularly, get this 15&#34; skillet.\\nthen the next thing I cooked was  peach cobbler and had no problem with sticking.\\nThe pan has a glassy coating after two treatments and two uses and does not have to be treated again.\\nNow after rinsing with hot water (no soap) I dry it with a dish towel, rub a dab of oil around it before putting it away.\\nCanola oil works better than olive oil for the treating because it can take the higher temp and is thinner.I can\\'t go 5 stars because the pan is heavy...but that\\'s the nature of cast iron...takes two hands to lift.I also have an enameled Le Creuset skillet but I like the straight sides of the Lodge better.\\nI\\'ve been wanting to buy this skillet for many months now, particularly when I\\'ve read how nonstick pans have a coating that eventually leaches into your food.\\nI have to admit, I was not attracted by the look of the pan, but did not want to shell out large amounts of money for the higher-end enamel skillets.\\n(I once had an aluminum wok that was well seasoned from years of use and I could cook eggs without them sticking, so I know one day, I\\'ll get that with this cast iron.)  Seasoning is easy.\\nAfter I clean the pan with hot water and a brush, I dry it with a towel.\\nI then use a pastry brush and brush a little oil on the pan, put it on the burner and turn the heat to medium high.\\nWhat could go wrong with an iron skillet?\\nCast iron cookware has excellent heat retention properties and can be produced and formed with a relatively low level of technology.\\nSeasoning is used to protect bare cast iron from rust and to create a non-stick surface.\\nAnd, in the past ten years the popularity of cast iron pans has increased every year.\\nIt is reasonably priced, easy to cook with and the food  tastes delicious.\\nThe most popular, and it seems, the last producer of good cast iron pans is Lodge.\\nBased in Tennessee, the company has a superb reputation.Cast iron cookware needs to be seasoned and \\'barefoot Bob\\' who has a popular review here seems to know the ins and outs, so follow his instructions.\\nAs reported this pre-seasoned pan tends to stick,,and with the use of any acidic product like tomatoes,the seasonng will go with the wind.\\nThus is the perfect pan, heart resistant handle that can and should be removed in hot ovens.\\nOnce seasoned, cook to your heart\\'s delight, and then wash with water,mdomypu if you like.\\nprisrob 06-30-14 I got this for my son who enjoys cooking and kept asking where he could get a cast iron skillet.\\nAmerican made Lodge cast iron is simply the best to cook with and is amazingly easy to maintain.\\nI have gotten rid of all my Teflon non-stick and don\\'t even use my All-Clad cookware anymore.\\nThe pan had a pit (-one star), surface is not super smooth and like other reviewers have said the preseasoning is a joke.\\nAfter cleaning with hot water and a scrubby brush, I just place it on the stove on low, and rub some on the surface with a paper towel.\\nI don\\'t care what they say about their magic heat conduction properties, medium high on non stick is NOT the same as high on a cast iron.\\nStill using a bit of oil before cooking things so not yet non-stick, but it makes cooking a joy.\\nI\\'ve been using Lodge cast iron skillets for many years and I\\'ve found they\\'re in fact \"pre-seasoned\" but never to my standards.\\nI wish they would give full disclosure and make it very clear to people that a truly well seasoned pan can\\'t be achieved in the factory because most consumers will confuse \"pre-seasoned\" with \"well seasoned\" and then will expect the same degree of non-stick from pre-seasoned pans that you can\\'t get until or unless it is well seasoned (which can take 10 to 30 uses).Properly pre-seasoning any pan is simple as long as you have a large oven.\\nCarbon steel has been long used to make woks and is now becoming popular in making fry pans and skillets.\\nJust remember carbon steel is fragile and can shatter like stoneware if dropped or mishandled, but make great natural and relatively light-weight non-stick cookware.PRE-SEASONING ANY CAST IRON:Heat your pan.\\nCoat the hot pan liberally inside and out with lard or vegetable oil (must be oil that can be used in high heat frying).\\nI do not recommend using any oil that is not designated for use with high heat as it will cause burning and give off gases that are not good for you to breathe in....\\nNow place your skillet/pan upside down in your oven at high temperature (300F to 500F, your preference, I like 350F for cast iron and 450F for carbon steel) for at least one hour.\\nThis bakes in a \"seasoning\" that protects the pan from rust and eventually provides a stick-resistant surface.\\nDoing it this way at home makes it more \"non-stick\".CLEANING CAST IRON:Cleaning affects past and future seasoning.\\nSeasoning is not done just at the start, when the pan is new.\\nSeasoning is done every time you use your pan/skillet.\\nSeasoning is done every time you add oil, either when cooking or after cleaning.\\nSeasoning is also done while cooking, as some foods add to the non-stick of the pan and to the flavor of the foods you cook over the years.\\nTo preserve and create better seasoning you must clean your cast iron correctly, never using soap.\\nAnd re-season (dry, heat, and oil it) periodically.\\nI coat my skillets with a thin layer of oil after I clean them - every time I clean them.\\nI clean them with hot water and a very stiff brush, I dry with a cotton towel, heat up to make sure all the water evaporates, add a thin coating of oil.\\nJust cleaning it with hot water and drying with a towel is not enough, in my opinion, because residual water that soaks into the cast iron can cause rust, even though you can\\'t see it.\\nThis will eventually cause sticking.USING CAST IRON:I coat my cast iron pans with oil after cleaning AND just before cooking.\\nAs long as you wipe it out the small amount of oil that clings to the pan will NOT have an adverse effect on your health (if you\\'re trying to avoid cooking with oil).\\nThis small amount of oil is just enough to help keep food from sticking.\\nIt does this by filling the pores of the metal.The whole idea of seasoning is to make sure oil is absorbed into the pores of the metal, not that you need the oil to cook your food.\\nYou can use extra oil to cook your food if you want, but with a well-seasoned pan very little added oil will be needed.\\nI know of no pan that comes seasoned that much.\\nIt\\'s always a process of using the pan over and over that gets it to true \"non-stick\".\\nThe more often you use and season your pan the smoother the surface will get and the more non-stick it will get.\\nIt can take 10, 20, or more uses (with proper washings and proper seasonings) before you see a nice smooth surface that is truly non-stick.\\nYou\\'ll know you\\'re achieved great seasoning when small drops of water or oil roll around in your pan like drops of rain on a well waxed car.PS) Some say frying a cup or more of chives in oil in your newly seasoned pan will help it become slicker faster (enhancing non-stick properties).\\nIt will also make the metal darker, and this will tell you it\\'s getting better seasoned.* For full disclosure:I did not buy my 8 inch Lodge skillet from Amazon but I wish I did.\\nI\\'ve purchased other Lodge skillets through Amazon and directly from Lodge, but I was in a hurry to get this 8 inch pan (I needed it that day for a dinner party) so I purchased from Fred Meyer and I paid over $16.\\nI really like knowing that I finally have a cast iron skillet.\\nI use coconut oil to keep it seasoned.\\nI already have a large cast-iron pan and a tiny one, so I wanted one that is medium sized to make a few eggs for breakfast.\\nI started using cast-iron as an alternative to non-stick and aluminum pans when I found out the dangers of using such pans.\\nNow I only use stainless steel and cast-iron and this one is a great one.\\na wonderful cast iron pan.\\na wonderful cast iron pan.\\ngreat for pasta, large skillet dishs.wish I had a cover.\\nLast Christmas we bought him his first cast iron piece, a Lodge 12\" cast iron skillet.\\nLodge dutch oven to get him for his birthday, but as I scrolled through the Lodge cast iron cookware and passed the Lodge 12\" skillet, I noticed it was on sale for $15.90, with free shipping.\\nI already own a Lodge 12\" cast iron skillet, but for that low price, now I have two.\\nIn reality, the Lodge cast iron skillet is a rarity, an excellent value at it\\'s normal retail price.\\nThe skillet will last a lifetime, with minimal care, and actually get better the more you use it.\\nThink of how many meals will be made over the course of a lifetime with a Lodge cast iron skillet, for the price of a single fast food meal for two.\\nI decided to buy Lodge seasoned cast iron 12\" pan because it is USA made, reasonable price, and many great reviews.\\nI followed the instructions to season it again and clean the pan, it is so easy!\\nThe cast iron pan does need a little more oil than the non-stick pan.\\nWhen doing stir-fry, the meat stick to the pan a little.\\nJust add a little water, the meat will come off the pan easily.\\nCast iron pan is heavy compared to my non-stick aluminum pans, but will take iron in my food anytime than aluminum.\\nThe handle is shorter than my regular pans, and the handle can get very hot during cooking.\\nI love my Lodge pans.\\nBut for the price, Lodge is the best price-performance product that still exceeds minimum standards of excellence to be used in a master chef kitchen.The 10.5&#34; pan itself is about 5 pounds.\\nIf you are not used to sturdy cookware, this may seem heavy, but if you want the best, you may find this to be the optimal balance between sufficient cooking mass to retain and distribute heat, and being still light enough to hold in one hand.\\nThe 6&#34; pan is light, but a little too small for many cooking jobs.\\nRub a little cooking oil on at the end of each use, too.\\nThe only time I wish I had a stainless steel pan is for frying eggs or fish, which are both very difficult to scrape of the pan (and don\\'t need the heating properties of cast iron, anyway).\\nI have several number 12 Lodge cast iron skillets.\\nI use them all the time and love them .\\nI then put alittle and I mean very little like a film of shortening back on the pan.Then store it till you use again.\\nAnother point for non stick is to get the skillet HOT first then add oil and cook your egges ect...!Cast iron the first NON STICK finish and my opinion is its the best.\\nI have had many other cookware pans but I always go back to cast iron.Lodge is best I can find on the market today!\\nThis pan has worked really well for several recipes on the stove top and outside.\\nWe really like it and have recommended it as a good value I didn\\'t know what pre-seasoned meant.\\nSurprisingly, oil is somehow baked into the finish of the cooking surface of the cast iron allowing you to cook foods and not worry about the food becoming hopelessly stuck to the pan.I love that I can get this pan HOT and not worry about what\\'s going to happen to the cooking surface.\\nThe pan imparts more of a grilled look and taste to meats than I\\'ve been able to achieve in my non-stick pans.This pan is tough and will last as long as I do.So far, the pan hasn\\'t been horribly sticky and it\\'s a breeze to clean with the polycarbonate pot scrapers.\\nI don\\'t use soap to clean it.\\nI then quickly scrape with the scrapers, rinse a few times, dry, lightly coat cooking surface with cooking oil and put it away.\\nShe is from the old school of ALWAYS cooking jn a cast iron skillet.\\nShe cannot wait to make her cornbread :-) As I have said in my other reviews...I LOVE cast iron cookware and I love Lodge.\\nMy grandmother used cast iron and so do I.\\nThe pros are numerous: it\\'s durable, easy to clean and maintain, it cooks evenly, and will last you literally FOREVER with proper care.\\nThis little skillet is great for sauteing mushrooms, onions or vegies.\\nCooking a small batch of cornbread and actually it\\'s great for just about anything!\\nI have several sizes of Lodge skillets from 8\" to the granddaddy 17\" inch size, griddles, loaf pans, pizza pans, etc.\\nI can\\'t say enough great things about Lodge!\\nI was skeptical about the pre-seasoning, but its done excellently and the pan cooks great out of the box.\\nI would have preferred the 10 inch pan only because this one is so heavy and probably takes longer to heat up than the smaller one.\\nI bought this preseasoned one but seasoned it anyways before I used it because it looked a little chipped.4 stars, only because of the size.\\nIt\\'s fantastic that such a great way for cooking meat is so highly recommended by chefs and foodies everywhere yet is still so affordable and accessible to everyone.The Lodge Logic cast iron skillets are amazingly solid and heavy skillets that are pre-seasoned and coated so they are ready to use and grill.These things literally last for years and have the important characteristic of getting extremely hot compared to an ordinary pan that will do wonders for your steak cooking.A few notes/advice:1) Don\\'t put a lot of oil on this.\\nA tiny bit is fine, but the char and coating of the skillet add to the flavor of the steak.2) Don\\'t use soap to clean this.\\nI made the mistake of not doing so and the cast iron can quickly rust.\\nIn most cases, the rust can be scrubbed off, but after a few times it can definitely be an issue and I bought a new one.4) These are great for placing in ovens.\\nThis is my first cast iron skillet.\\nThis is my first cast iron skillet.\\nThis is my first cast iron skillet.\\nThis is my first cast iron skillet.\\nThis is my first cast iron skillet.\\nAfter trying it out for a couple of months, I totally love it.I find it perfect for cooking one or two eggs in the morning.\\nSo if you don\\'t like the weight of cast iron cookware, this one is not a problem.Things like eggs got sticky at the beginning, but after several times of use, it became as easy as non-stick skillets.\\nEven better, I use less oil to cook eggs with this skillet.\\nI wish I had discovered cast iron sooner.\\nIt holds heat so well I can finally get a nice sear on a steak with my old weak stove burner.\\nIt\\'s a plus that this pan already comes pre-seasoned.\\nIt\\'s a bit heavy but hey it\\'s cast iron.\\nThis is a good value as these last forever with proper care not like the teflon coated pans which are dangerous to use when the coating eventually starts peeling (poison).Her only recommendation is to clean and dry it as soon as it cools.It becomes harder to clean if you let pan greases sit in it over night.If you lose the shine on this just coat it with a little vegetable oil and leave it in the oven with the pilot light on for a couple of days and it will be good as new.\\nFor the first few times I used this 9&#34; skillet, I had to scrape the bottom hard to keep food from sticking and burning.\\nThen, after a few more times of use and proper cleaning, it began to get easier where the food didn\\'t stick as much as it did at first.\\nFinally, after using this skillet 8 times and cleaning it properly, food no longer sticks to it!!\\nThe only con about this skillet is that it has a rough surface on the inside, Lodge could have made this a lot smoother than it is, but overall doesn\\'t seem to matter too much as, again, it now works like a teflon skillet.\\nAs a first time cast iron owner, I need directions for maintnenance.\\nIt is heavy and cooks well, just need to know how to clean it.\\nNothing lightweight about this cast-iron skillet.\\nI use it primarily for frying and it maintains the heat perfectly for large batches of fish or chicken.\\nI also own the 12 inch skillet which is great.\\nThis is my first cast iron pan (that I\\'ve owned, I mean--I do have some experience with them), after years of dealing with aluminum and some stainless steel.\\nThis is probably the best-priced cast iron pan you can find, and it\\'s working great for me so far.\\nLodge\\'s website recommends washing with no soap if you know your pan got hot enough to sanitize anything on it, but they do say mild soap can be OK if you\\'re really concerned about it.\\nBasically, I recommend following the manufacturer\\'s instructions if you\\'ve never used these before since they might be different from what you\\'re used to.One note: the entire pan is cast iron, including the handle.\\nSince this is not insulated, you\\'ll want to remember to use a pot holder or slip on a silicone or other protective pan handle cover on it.\\nThere is a lip/spout on side of the pan that can help with this, although I\\'ve never cooked something liquid enough for it to be useful for me.\\nI\\'ve used mine exclusively on the stovetop, but they are also versatile in that they can be used in the oven or just about any heat source (campfire, etc.) except a microwave.In summary, this is a great pan, and it\\'s quickly become my favorite skillet.\\nIt is a bit heavy (hard to lift with one hand while trying to scrape the contents into a bowl, for example), but that\\'s the case with pretty much any good cast iron pan and something I\\'m learning to work around better.\\nIf mine gets a little too dirty, I\\'ll scrape with the Lodge scraper, coat with canola oil, heat up a bit, then mop up with paper towels.\\nThese skillets are great for a fried egg, and I really mean \\'A\\' fried egg but they are better for using to serve appetizers in.\\nTo start, I did preseason the pan in the oven for 3 hours, twice.\\nPut down a layer of aluminum foil below if you\\'re concerned about drips.I\\'ve used the pan a dozen times or so, and have never had a sticking problem, or any difficulty cleaning it.\\nThe first time, I did see a hint of rust on the bottom inside of the pan the next day, so now I spritz it with a bit of Pam before I hang it on my pot rack.\\nI will be trying chicken this way soon.I\\'ve noticed this pan cooks on a lower heat setting.\\nThe food was a bit too soft.This pan is not good for sauteeing chef style (where you flip the pan by hand), as it\\'s just too heavy for that.Best tools/methods:Preseason it.Pam (for storage and cooking).\\nThis pan is heavy and requires a bit of extra care to ensure it doesn\\'t rust, but it cooks very evenly, holds its heat extremely well, is made in the U.S.A., and will become a family heirloom.\\nit does the work that you would expect for a cast iron skillet.\\nIt will definitely rust if you leave any type of wet food or liquid in it for more than ten minutes, but that\\'s easy to clean off with a bit of oil and some kosher salt wiped around with paper towels.\\nWe bought this pan over two years ago.\\nWe\\'ve seared meat on top of the stove, then transferred it to the oven to finish cooking.Everyone needs this pan in their kitchen as a kitchen basic!\\nIt\\'s a big skillet, made of cast-iron.\\nI bought the 15&#34; pan because \\'bigger is better\\', and it cost the same or less than the 12&#34;.\\nIf I do, I will most likely use the smaller skillet on more of a day-to-day basis.\\nMy wife and I have a good relationship; but after receiving this skillet I am going to make sure it stays that way.\\nI love this pan and use it frequently.\\nI don\\'t have issues with maintaining the season or with the heating up time, etc.\\nI wish i had a good lid for it,  and i rusted it very slightly on the bottom trying to clean it over just a few hours, but that\\'s easy to fix.\\nThey asked me what they would need for their kitchen, so I got them each 2 skillets -- an 8&#34; and a 10&#34;.\\nLodge Logic makes the best cast iron products for the best price.\\nI had a 10&#34; pre-seasoned skillet that worked wonderfully but now I have upgraded to a 12&#34;!\\nI bought this with the idea of using it for frying an egg or two, since eggs stick to my stainless pans.\\nMy old teflon pan was ideal for frying eggs; they slide right off.\\nStraightforward cast iron skillet.\\nThe pretreatment is better than nothing, but it does still requires some seasoning, or at least some regular use for awhile before it reaches full seasoning, so don\\'t be surprised if things stick a little in the beginning despite the pretreatment.\\nCast iron gets better with time with a lot of use, as long as one doesn\\'t use soap.\\nIf food is allowed to cool in it and it is stuck on, it is still easy to clean with hot water, a stiff brush, and a little elbow grease.\\nI would give it five stars but I\\'ve noticed all of my newer Lodge cast iron pans are not exactly flat like the old ones.\\nThis pan is the perfect size for my household.\\nThe small handle opposite the main handle makes it much easier to pick up, because, like all cast iron pans, it is heavy.\\nThis skillet is turning out to be a very handy addition to my large (and growing) collection of Lodge Logic cast iron.It\\'s a great size to fry a couple of eggs (and since a lid from another set of cookware fits, I can poach the eggs in this skillet too), reheat a single portion of leftovers, or bake up that cup or two of leftover batter (so who wants to pop the muffin pan back into the oven for such a small amount?).All in all, a great little pan!\\nIn fact I love it to and I find myself using this more then she does, we rarely even use our other pans.\\nLighter than the 12&quot; pan - still works great.\\nBy getting the Pre-Seasoned version, you don\\'t have to worry about being extra careful with your first few uses.\\nthe pan is very well seasoned and the silicone handle is comfortable.\\nThis is my second cast iron skillet.\\nI never thought I would use cast iron with of all the cookware on the market today.\\nBut, I love how it cooks, high temps and easy clean up.\\nDefinitely use pan scrappers on it.\\nJust a great solid cast iron pan.\\nI am not keen on the pre-seasoning they do - it doesn\\'t seem overly effective - especially if you cook sticky stuff like eggs and has a curious rough texture instead of a smooth to the touch finish you expect from well seasoned pans.However, these are way cheaper than used griswolds and wagners on ebay, and with a little care and seasoning becomes as good as them IMO, so definitely would recommend.\\nTL;DR version - The skillet is awesome, it cooks everything from dutch babies to searing meat without any sticking or hot spots.\\nNo kitchen is complete without a cast iron skillet.------Now that\\'s out of the way, if you haven\\'t cooked with cast iron you\\'re missing out, and you\\'ve also got a lot to learn, so here\\'s a crash course to help figure out if this skillet is right for you.Advantages of cast iron:* cast iron has a high density, thus is retains heat extremely well* it\\'s great at distributing even heat* properly seasoned cast iron can perform with the best non-stick pans* they are built to last longer than you, many are passed down generation to generation* you could rearrange a home intruder\\'s face with a good swing of a cast iron panDisadvantages of cast iron:* unseasoned cast iron will rust quicker than you imagine* takes longer to heat up than your nonstick or steel* will probably crack if thermally shocked or dropped* they are heavier than any other type of cooking vesselA lot of the disadvantages of cast iron are easily addressable with a bit of common sense.\\nFirst and foremost, cast iron has to be completely seasoned.\\nThe good news is, this is pretty easy to do and the more you use the pan the better your seasoning gets.Seasoning your cookware:There are many discussions as to how to properly season cast iron.\\nThe discrepancies are what type of fat to use, the baking temp/time, and the best practices to maintain your seasoning.Traditionalists will argue that lard is best, because that\\'s the way it always has been done.\\nThe Lodge skillet comes unpolished, meaning it has a textured surface.\\nI think before I do the flax seed oil seasoning, I will likely use a dremel/sandpaper to smooth the cooking surface purely for aesthetic purposes to flaunt that I take care of my cookware.\\nPolished cast iron does offer the benefit of more exposed internal pores, so the seasoning sticks better, but I\\'ve never had an issue seasoning so this point is moot.I\\'ve done both high heat and medium heat for seasoning, and I find that the hotter the oven the better the seasoning.\\nIf you fail to season above 350f, you will likely end up with a browned pan that is slightly sticky because the fat didn\\'t form a polymer, and will make you leave an unnecessary low star Amazon review and never know the benefits of cast iron.\\nMy suggestion is scrub the skillet with steel wool and soap until the water runs clear and you\\'re sure there\\'s no soap remaining on the cast iron.\\nDry the skillet completely, and cover with oil; make sure you get the handles, bottom, and top.\\nHeat the oven to 400f to 500f and put the skillet in there and bake for an hour - not including the preheating time.\\nAfter the hour, shut off the oven and allow the skillet to cook down.\\nThis initial seasoning layer isn\\'t quite ready for primetime, if you were to cook something with tomatoes, lemons, vinegar you could very well screw it all up because of the low PH reacting to the thin layer of fat polymer and possibly penetrating all the way to the cast iron.\\nToo much science for me, so to be on the safe side if I\\'m going to be using the oven with temperatures in excess of 375f I make sure the cast iron gets another layer of fat and gets re-seasoned.\\nFirst and foremost, I use metal utensils on it because it inevitably makes it easier to clean if stuff isn\\'t stuck to it for very long.\\nI\\'ve read that because we generally don\\'t use dish soaps that contain lye, they should be gentle enough to use on cast iron.\\nIt may not have the same shine, but you should be completely drying the skillet and applying a real thin coat of oil to it.\\nIt\\'s important to continuously use the skillet to maintain the coat.\\nLove this size of cast iron skillet, it is perfect for one egg and sauteing onion and garlic.\\nBut just to warn you it is a lot heavier than non-cast iron skillets.\\nAlso, I was told my many people (including the teacher of a cooking class I am taking) that these skillets should not be put in the dishwasher.\\nI\\'ve been looking for a really good cast iron pan and I finally found it!\\nI love the silicone handle.It made transferring the pan from the stove to oven so easy and I didn\\'t have to worry about burning my hands.\\nThis is the first time i am using a cast iron pan.\\nThis is the first time i am using a cast iron pan.\\nI was little apprehensive about the 15 inch size, after a few days of use i am convinced that this is the size i need.I started using right out of the box.\\nmade some curries, haven\\'t started using for tomato based preparations, may be after a while.I am sure I\\'ll continue to use this BIGGGGG pan for life time & continue to add more cast iron tools in my kitchen towards healthy way of eating & living.\\nThis one has a rough interior surface that my older pans don\\'t have, so I don\\'t like it as well.\\nIt was a very good price and I love that it came with the silicone handle that\\'s removable.\\nIt came with two cracks but I believe it\\'s because it came with a smaller cast iron pan and it wasn\\'t packaged properly.\\nIf you can...ask friends, relatives or go to garage sales to find vintage cast iron pans because they\\'re the best.\\nFantastic cast iron pan.\\nThe fact that it comes pre-seasoned is such a time saver.\\nOf course I still did my own seasoning after making a few meals, just because other cast iron users recommended so.\\nI love the versatility of cast iron over my non-stick cookware...you can go from stove top into oven.\\nI\\'ll be acquiring more lodge cast iron!\\nHave been using for 1 week,Spray with GV  non stick cooking oil  before and after each use, wipe with paper towel, Eggs slide out like a non stick coated pan.\\nIt does have a iron taste that  will fade with use.This skillet is better than some of the cheaper cast on the market ,It has smooth clean edges,  Always use cast , they can\\'t be beat.\\nPut the pan in your oven, heat to 450 for at least 20 minutes.\\nPut room temperature rib-eye steaks in the pan, put back in the oven for 3-4 minutes.\\nLodge Logic L10SK3 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet, always loved cast iron and this Skillet is no different.\\nGood coating and cooks great!\\nLodge is the ONLY cast iron skillet you should ever consider.\\nI have been a big fan of cast iron for awhile now, and have had this Lodge Logic pan for about 4 years.\\nI have used pans from several different cast iron manufacturers, but after watching a video on their manufacturing process, I favor Lodge Logic over the others.\\nThe handle on my 8\" cast iron pan is larger than this one.\\nThis is a big pan, and the handle needs to be 1\" longer, and .5\" wider to be able to easily maneuver this very heavy pan, especially when you consider that people will be wearing oven mitts, which leaves even less room.\\nIt is just way too short and thin for a pan of this size.\\nAs soon as I got the pan, I followed the instructions, which only consisted of rinsing in hot water.\\nI have been using cast iron pans for a long time.\\nI have three other cast iron pans that are beautifully seasoned, and I have self-seasoned cast iron at least 20 times.\\nI know how to care for these pans and how to use them.\\nI would suggest that anyone who gets this, season it first a few times before cooking with high heat.\\nYou can do this by coating it with vegetable oil and putting it in the over for a couple hours, or just cook some bacon and sausage in it a few times and it should be fine.Aside from the handle problem and this, it is a great pan and I\\'m sure I will have it for years to come, but don\\'t trust the manufacturer\\'s seasoning and do it yourself.Some of the accessories I use with mine are:Lodge Set of 2 Durable Polycarbonate Pan Scrapers,Red and Black- These things are great.\\nI struggled for years with trying to clean the pan without soap and without scrubbing off the seasoning patina.\\nYou can then put the pan on low or medium, drop some kosher salt into it, and put a folded up paper towel over the salt mound and use it as an abrasive to scrub off any other food and clean it.\\nWipe it out once and coat with a thin layer of vegetable oil while the pan is warm.\\nThen lay a paper towel inside it and it is ready until next use.Lodge Max Temp Handle Mitt, Black- A handle mitt is great for leaving on the handle, which will get very hot.\\nThis way you don\\'t have to worry about forgetting to pick up the pan with a towel or oven mitt and accidentally burning your hand.Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Rectangular Cast-Iron Grill Press- Use this for flattening out your bacon or pressing down on a grill cheese sandwich.\\nOk, if you want a cast iron MONSTER- the 15 inch skillet is for you.\\nIf it is your first cast iron skillet go with a smaller size.\\nGreat size for a single person to whip up an omelette or hash browns or anything else I would do with a frying pan.\\nI love my cast iron pans!\\nI love my cast iron pans!\\nI bought 3 different Lodge cast iron pans and they seem to be very high quality.\\nThe pre-seasoning works great and they are easy to clean with just warm water.They are easy to work with but do require adjusting your cooking method compared to steep or aluminum pans.\\n- I tend to warm the skillet for a few 5mins on med-low heat (while empty) and turn the heat off 5mins before the end of cooking time.\\n(The cast iron hold its heat long enough to continue to cook for 5-10mins).The only issue I have with these pans is when adding minced garlic to a dish being fried.\\nThe garlic tends to stick and damages the patina if not removed immediately after cooking.I messed up the finish on one pan (by scrubbing the patina off), but followed the instructions on Lodge\\'s website to re-season and it worked perfect.I definitely recommend these pans.\\nCan cook 2 things at once in this pan.\\nVery roomy can cook entire breakfast!Although I do like to caution to everyone that cast iron is heavy!\\nWe have aLodge Logic LPGI3 Pro Grid Cast Iron Grill/GriddleandLodge Logic L10SK3 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skilletthat we love, the latter of which resides permantly on our stove.\\nAlso quite heavy....Cast iron is great for moving things from the stove to the oven, such as with roasting vegetables.\\nWe often don\\'t wash it right away, and we cook tomato-based foods and curries and such in it, and the seasoning is holding up well.\\nI have always been a fan of iron skillets.\\nsolid cast iron.\\nI bought this as a quick and inexpensive way to cook up stir fry.\\nIn the end, I\\'ve found that scrubbing out the pan with plain hot water and a synthetic pad or brush will do the trick.Did I mention that this skillet is HEAVY?\\nI\\'m 190 and in relatively good shape, and the skillet can still be a bear to handle.\\nIt\\'s definitely stick resistant but the surface roughness makes cleaning with paper towels difficult because the pan picks up fibers from the towel.\\nDo NOT let being a \"cast iron snob\" deter you from buying a $20 pre-seasoned skillet.When I received it, I put it next to an 80-year-old perfectly-seasoned griddle and they looked almost identical.I\\'ve been making grilled cheese sandwiches left and right since it arrived and even the \"stuck-on\" cheese wipes right up with a damp paper towel.If there\\'s a similar dutch oven, I\\'m buying it STAT!\\nI *love* my cast iron skillet and the 12-inch model has been a dream in so many ways.But ladies, you need to realize how heavy this big boy really is.For years, I\\'ve needed to cook for large groups.\\nNow that it\\'s just my husband and me, I don\\'t need such a large cooking pot and I can\\'t handle it anyway.You can forget picking it up with one hand and pouring out gravy while scraping with the other.\\nThat is a LOT of hot pan for one hand to tip and control.\\nAdd the weight of the food, and it\\'s not reasonable for the average middle-age woman to handle this pan.Just remember - NO SOAP.\\nI then reheat my pan to dry it then lightly re-oil it.\\nIt\\'s easier than it sounds and ends up becoming a natural part of cleaning the kitchen after a meal.******************************I just knocked it down another star because I bought a Camp Chef and now I know the difference.I thought that the Lodge pre-season was what we had to deal with in life.\\nThis is the third Lodge skillet I\\'ve owned and I use it almost every day.\\nI purchased the 10.25\" one.So long as you handle it properly, heat it slowly and add a bit of oil before the food, your food will never stick.I was admittedly skeptical about a preseasoned pan, I\\'d heard so many bad things.\\nI had forgotten how much I loved cooking with a cast iron skillet.\\nI have been seasoning this along the way and it is perfect for your braising and high temperature frying.\\nI\\'m a newbie skillet user but my significant other said he made the best egg sandwich EVER in this thing!\\nThe first time I used the pan the chicken dish did not stick.\\nI washed the pan with only water and a sponge dried completely and put a little cooking oil on and put it away.\\nNext day the second time I used the pan I was frying potatoes and they stuck super bad!\\nThis is my first cast iron pan and I am very disappointed!\\nDo not understand why other reviews say the pan is non stick.\\nNow nothing sticks and I just wipe clean with paper towels and water and finish with a light coat of oil.\\nThis is the first cast iron skillet I have owned.\\nThis is the first cast iron skillet I have owned.\\nI had some issues at first adjusting to cast iron but now that I\\'ve used it a bit and got used to it, I love it!\\nThis is a MINIATURE skillet, as they advertise, so to say it is small (like that\\'s a bad thing) doesn\\'t make much sense.\\nI didn\\'t purchase it to cook meals in because I was well aware of its size going in.\\nI love it just because...I give it five stars for two reasons - 1) It is cute as a bug; and 2) It\\'s made by Lodge, so it is clearly great quality cast iron.Admittedly I have not actually \\'used\\' it for anything, but then I had no aspirations of it serving any practical purpose.\\nI called my daughter and told her to be sure and always buy a Lodge brand when she buys a iron skillet:-)  I hope to buy more and replace my pots and pans with iron.\\nGreat cooked food and healthy in iron and can always cook outside on a open fire in an emergency or camping.\\nInexpensive, great quality, cooks evenly, works as advertized.\\nI only buy LODGE when it comes to cast iron.\\nDO NOT USE SOAP EVER ON A CAST IRON.\\nThen dry and put a dollop of olive oil or the like on it and spread it around the pan so it prevents rust.\\n(this is best done when the pan is still hot) Great size for bigger jobs.\\nI can easily sear two large steaks or several chicken breasts in this skillet at the same time.\\nCan\\'t think of buying something else when it comes to cast iron products.\\nAlso even after applying oil to the pan the egg still tends to stick.\\nOf any other skillets I have purchased, I would stick with Lodge.\\nGood size pan.\\nI ordered two of these 6.5 inch skillets for my adult son to cook personal dishes with.\\nThey are exactly like my Lodge 10\" seasoned skillet and I will order more mini skillets for myself.\\n;-) first time using a skillet this heavy.\\neasy to use , looked at many videos to learn how to season the pan.\\nvery good product Very happy with the pan.\\nIts been 4 months I bought this and its non-stick from the first use.\\nThey don\\'t stick and the taste is great.Two minor problems: One, its heavy, and second, the handle gets very hot.\\nI always leave a cheap (99c from Ikea) oven mit on the handle.Amazon.com is the only place (that my friends & I know of) that sells these wonderful cast iron skillets for price this low.\\nEvery time I use it I feel good about providing  jobs in the USA and the quality is excellent.\\nIt\\'s the perfect size for a grilled cheese, 2-4 scrambled eggs, and many other small cooking tasks.\\nClean up was super easy--hot water and a little elbow grease.\\nThey secret is to let the pan get warm then add the cooking fat.\\nThis is a good size to fry 3 or 4 eggs.\\nIt\\'s the perfect size if you have to cook something that\\'s not too large or too small.\\nThis is my go-to skillet for a wide range of cooking I do these days, and it excels at pan-frying and searing meat.Clean-up is surprisingly easy, if quite a bit different than the non-stick cookware I (used to) use; usually I deglaze the pan with about a cup or two of water immediately after cooking, then, once the skillet has cooled, I pour out the water, scrape off any loose debris with a spatula, dry it with paper towels, then pour a couple tablespoons of kosher salt and peanut oil into the pan, scrubbing it with more paper towels and then clean off the salt.\\nI just used this pan for the first time.\\nIt is a large fry pan and for that fact alone I love it.\\nI do agree with most of the reviews on the cast iron products that the seasoning on these

cooking.\\nI am trying to replace all my pans and pots with cast iron.\\nI just love all my Lodge products and this 8 inch skillet is no different.\\nI recommended seasoned cast iron and he tried this skillet.\\nNeed I say, he\\'s sold on cast iron!\\nThese come pre-seasoned so those who are intimidated by seasoning cast iron can relax - this skillet really is well seasoned & is truly &#34;no stick.&#34; When my husband destroyed our Calphalon omelet pan by overheating it (again), I decided it was time for cast iron.\\nIt took me a long time to purchase this skillet because I couldn\\'t decide between a pre-seasoned skillet or a new one that required seasoning.\\nAfter doing some research and finding multiple recommendations for this brand (including one from my favorite food blogger), I decided to give it the pre-seasoned one a try.\\nDon\\'t let the reputation of cast iron scare you off - it\\'s easy to cook with once you get the hang of it.\\nEasy to use, easy to care for - a great addition to any kitchen!\\nPrior to purchasing this skillet, I hadn\\'t  used a cast iron skillet since the early 80s.\\nWell, after purchasing several sets of pots and pans over the past 25 years + I decided to go back to cast iron.\\nIt cooks better and can be used outside on a campfire, inside in the oven or on a stove top.\\nNow I\\'m going to purchase another cast iron skillet and a dutch oven and call it a day.The old-fashioned way is the best way in my opinion when it comes to cooking and baking.\\nIf you are smart & don\\'t use soap on this pan, it become as non-stick as any Teflon pan.\\nI use a stiff brush & some warm water, usually works great, especially if you do it right after taking the food out of the pan.\\nIf there is food stuck on the bottom of the pan that does not easily come out using the stiff brush & warm water, then just put some water in the pan, sit it back on the stove until the water starts to simmer, then scrub the pan right away- that has worked for me every time.\\nIf you use soap on this pan then you will ruin the non-stick effect & will have to start from scratch by oiling down the pan, sticking it in a hot oven for a bit-

pan when I\\'m done.\\nFollowing others advice, I just cooked bacon for the first time and I was good to go.\\nBeen using it mainly for cooking egg souffles actually to cook what we feel in love with in Istanbul: [...]good size for a single hearty meal.\\n...just using a bigger cast iron skillet and cooking the eggs on one side of the pan with the heat concentrated under it.\\nI prefer to cook over-easy eggs with this size skillet, one at a time, but I would recommend just using your larger cast iron skillet for the same task, at no extra charge.It does it\\'s job perfectly fine, but I wouldn\\'t bother spending more money than you have to.\\nI found the skillet to be pretty well-seasoned.\\nI prefer to use it for anything that needs to go from the stove top to the oven.It\\'s a great quality, super heavy + great price.\\nI love Lodge cast iron pans and own many.\\nI cook so many things in these smaller cast iron pans I probably could fill the page but I won\\'t bore people.\\nJust figure anything you can cook in a regular stainless steel pan (which I own many of) will cook better in a well seasoned, loved and used Lodge cast iron pan!\\nGreat pans, if properly cared for, will live on long after you and I are gone!\\nWe use this particular pan on a daily basis and have done so for years.\\nWe keep the bacon grease from cooking bacon in it for a week or so at a time, which obviously keeps it well-seasoned and lets us cook fried eggs in it easy as pie.\\nIf you eat real food for breakfast I would definitely recommend having a Lodge cast iron pan dedicated to just this task.\\nIf you don\\'t have a lid then tuck this pan into the oven when not in use, to keep anything from getting into the bacon grease.I\\'m sure I\\'ll just echo everyone else when I see Lodge cast iron is excellent quality and the price is outstanding for what you\\'re getting (a pan that will last forever, instead of a non-stick pan that is bad for your health and will only last a couple of years).\\nThis small skillet is great!\\nI use it for baking cornbread, braising meat, blackened fish, etc...It\\'s size is perfect for one or two people.\\nUse it a while to build a non-stick surface before cooking eggs on it.\\nThese 2 just get stick with each other.3 It works really well to pan fry anything that is not porous.\\nWhen I use it to make golden pan fry dumplings, I just put in dumplings at very low temperature, it may look like it is sticky at the beginning, just be patient and the dumpling will come off easily when it is ready (golden at the bottom)4.\\nI have to use lots of cooking oil, some of which I guess fills the porous bottom.\\nLodge cast-iron skillets are very good quality, which you want when you\\'re considering buying cast iron.I knew this would be a good skillet, and when I saw the great price, I ordered one for my father-in-law, who lives and cooks alone.\\nAt least with this cast iron skillet from lodge if I get a chunk of it in my food it\\'s only iron and your body needs that anyway.\\nI agree, this is the perfect little skillet for a single serving size of potatoes.\\nPlace skillet in oven and bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes or until tender.\\nTop with cheddar cheese.I make this in my 8 inch cast iron skillet a lot.\\nIt also makes the best hash browns and since it\\'s not that heavy and already preseasoned, you can flip the hash browns like the pro\\'s!The 8\" and 6\" cast iron skillets are also great for tapas.\\nI am a complete convert to cast-iron cooking.\\nSeasoning a cast-iron pan is very easy (follow the included instructions or do a Google search) and once you get used to the process of keeping it seasoned, which is simple, and cleaning it, which is very simple, you will never go back to non-stick.I now own a 12\", a 10\" and an 8\" Lodge skillet.\\nI have a 10\" lid which fits both the Dutch Oven (which it came with) and the 10\" skillet.\\nI have been very happy with Lodge products and will continue to add them to my cooking arsenal as I need them.The first time you remove something from the stove top and place it directly into the oven in the same pan, you will be hooked.\\nEspecially when you can clean the properly seasoned pan with just a few wipes of a wet cloth no matter what you\\'ve cooked in it.Here is a tip for making cleaning a cast-iron skillet easier with no scrubbing.\\nJust as you would use a liquid to reduce a sauce in a recipe (which also serves to get all the little flavorful bits sticking to the pan off); after you are finished cooking, dump a cup or two of water into the hot pan and let it boil for a few minutes.\\nDump this out and run a little fresh water into the pan and you should be able to easily wipe it clean with a damp cloth.\\nThe best food I have ever cooked came out of this pan, from a well seared steak to juicy bacon cheeseburgers.\\nLove that I can use the pan on stove top and in the oven.P.S. If you want the perfect steak I recommend Alton Brown\\'s method in the first Good Eats episode: [...] I read about the seasoned pans on some food blog and, considering the price, I decided to go for it.\\nAt first I only cooked greasy things in it, to give it that extra seasoning, things like bacon, fried chicken, etc.\\nI just put it under hot running water, scrub whatever food is still in the pan with the brush and DONE!\\nThis pan is always clean and ready for anything!\\nI\\'ve never had a pan before that I\\'ve been able to use on the stovetop and then just shove right into the oven - and it has really opened up a whole new area of cooking for me!\\nI have had this skillet for a long time.\\nAfter having used this for so long, I have finally learned how to use it better.There are several different versions of how you season a cast iron skillet.\\nAnd I wondered why food would stick to the skillet.\\nMore recently, I have not had those same problems.I had moved away from cast iron skillets to nonstick skillets.\\nMy recent return to my 12 inch cast iron skillet has convinced me to use this as opposed to my nonsticks.\\nI even purchased a cast iron Dutch Oven recently as a result of recent successes with this tool.So, a satisfied user.\\nI read so many complaints by those that taken the time to understand how to use and care for cast iron cookware.\\nI Don\\'t know that much but I heard that after cooking you use water to boil it clean then wash it, then to dry it you fry it dry.\\nThat said, thousands of 5 star reviews say Lodge cast iron is the best of the best.\\nand food just cooks better and evenly in cast iron.\\nback to nature with the lodge pans.\\nWith each successive use, this pan gets better and better.\\nI do clean the pan immediately after each use, which prevents buildup on the surface that impairs even heating.\\nNever loved cast iron in the past, but this is great.\\nRequires minimal upkeep (use a brush to clean it, pour a little oil into it and wipe it around with a paper towel, store it in the stove where it\\'s a little warm).\\nThis is the only frying pan I use anymore, for everything from pancakes to browning meats.\\nIt\\'s just a matter of taking care of it, cleaning it soon after you use and and never, ever, letting it sit in water.\\nIt\\'s easy to clean and food does not get baked on to the surface.\\nI am fairly new to cast iron, but this was my latest buy and I was not disappointed!\\nI grew up with cast iron skillets but hadn\\'t used one in years.\\nThis is a good product that will get lots of use.\\n(But then, so am I...)  I love cast iron for cooking, but you need to know how to clean them properly in order for them to remain seasoned so that they don\\'t rust, and food doesn\\'t stick.\\nCast iron is heavy - so the addition of the small handle on a big pan makes it much easier to handle safely.\\nThere are some recipes that just taste better when you use these old iron pans.\\nThe flavor of food made in these iron pans is just to die for.\\nGreat quality.Yes the pieces are heavy, but truly the best for frying, grilling, and roasting.I don\\'t like to use non stick pans anymore, these items give you the ease of non stick clean up (let the pan cool, rinse in warm water, wipe clean, rub a little oil and your done) and the taste and control for good cooking.I have a full assortment of high quality All Clad, which is good for somethings, but the Lodge items are my favorite cookware.\\nhad a few cast iron pans - Lodge is the way to go and preseasoned makes your life a lot easier - I like this one - can\\'t say i will use it for everything - but it is the way to sear and cook a steak if you want it brown on outside and rare on inside - i like this one I find that when I want to pan fry chicken this is the best skillet to use.So far I have not had any issues, but if I do, I will season again.Glad I purchased it.\\nI never used a iron skillet before, and I knew that they require some special care, so I was very nervous about buying one, but so far we\\'ve been managing great.\\nAnd a lot of the food we like DOES taste better prepared this way - much crispier.\\nI will replace them all with Lodge Logic cast iron skillets of all different sizes!!\\nThere are a lot of things that just taste better on a cast iron skillet.\\nJust get a scrub brush and use hot water only when cleaning.\\nAlso make sure it is pre-heated before you start cooking (about 10 minutes on medium-low heat).\\nI use this skillet daily.\\nI bought this on a Whim, I think it was on Special for less than $8.00You can\\'t beat Cast Iron, Once it\\'s seasoned properly, even though these are Pre-Seasoned, They just seem to cook better if you season them with oil for a 1/2 hour on Low heat.This Pan works Great for Frying 1 - 2 Eggs or Saut&eacute;ing onions, peppers etc..or even frying a single Hamburger.\\nI have a cast iron Wok that I purchased from the WokShop in San Francisco (check out their web site), to me it is the only kind of wok to purchase as it gives that really authentic \"oriental\" flavor to whatever you cook in it (preheating a dry Wok is essential before adding oil).\\nI find this is also true for for the cast iron skillet.\\nIt just gives great flavor to the food not to mention the addition of beneficial iron.\\nThe Lodge skillet doesn\\'t require seasoning which is a plus.\\nThe cast iron skillet is significantly more heavy (7 lb.) than my Wok however.\\nI would still recommend this skillet just be prepared for an upper body workout when using and washing it, but hey we can all use more exercise can\\'t we!\\nThe only downside is the handle is a little short for the weight of the pan.\\nThe way my husband cooks has destroyed a few of the non-stick teflon pans I bought that are as expensive, if not more expensive than these Lodge Logic cast iron skillets.\\nEach of the pans/skillets I buy will last no more than a 5 months before he destroys them.\\nI finally asked for some cast iron skillets to replace them.\\nWhen I use the skillets food never sticks on them, so I am not sure what secret technique my husband\\'s using to get food to stick.After using the pans, some salt (I use table salt) and oil with a sponge will clean off the surface of the skillet.\\nThen, just rinse with hot water (remember to wear gloves), dry it off with a towel, coat with a layer of oil, and leave it on the side for next time.I liked these skillets so much I just bought a griddle/grill combo from them too.\\nTherefore, this is why I purchased this brand and also the fact being PRE SEASONED was another reason.The next item in line I had to consider was the size.\\nI think it is perfect for a first cast iron piece.\\nAfter reading other reviews, I seasoned the skillet several more times in the oven at 500 degrees for an hour at a time to obtain the dark black surface coating they were describing.\\nI\\'ve used the skillet several times and I\\'m very happy with the results and cleanup has been surprisingly easy.\\nI bought this for my daughter who has wanted a cast iron skillet for a long time.\\nIt is a nice size and pre-seasoned is a huge plus.\\npeople still wonder why I continue to use cast iron, I can only say that you NEVER will replace it if you care for it right....\\nShe said nothing sticks from the first time she used it because it is pre-seasoned.\\nI love cooking with cast iron skillets and have several.\\nI love cooking with cast iron skillets and have several.\\nThis is a simple heavy-duty cast iron pan that gets the job done and the food tastes great.\\nIt looked very well seasoned when I bought it but I like to season my own Cast iron Pans so I just added layers on top of the pan as soon as I got it.\\nFood tastes great and this pan will last me  forever This 12\" iron skillet from Lodge is quality-made and durable, about half the price of the best-known French brand with the fancy-coloured outside coating.It\\'s much tougher than non-stick pans and endures much higher temperatures.\\nI\\'ve oven-cooked meat on it, and found it great for roasting potatoes.\\nThe reason it\\'s so good is the heat-retaining properties of the tough natural iron.\\nOnce heated, it takes ages to cool down again and this is great for cooking almost anything.\\nIf you\\'re using oil it remains hot much longer so the food tastes better.As a fry-pan it\\'s not as non-stick as Teflon but I found if you season it, it\\'s then almost as good.\\nYou season it by coating the inside with oil, then baking it in the oven for an hour which binds the oil molecules to the iron so they won\\'t wash out - just like a traditional wok.\\nThe pan seems to get better non-stick properties the more it\\'s used.Caution: these iron pans are heavy compared to similar-sized teflon-coated aluminium pans, so the larger ones are more difficult to lift and use if you\\'re light of frame.\\nThis was my first cast iron piece, so I spent ages reading up on how to season/maintain and all that.\\nI didn\\'t buy it on Amazon, but wanted to share my experience with it and hope that it helps someone.First, the pre-seasoning is not very useful.\\nGet rid of it using steel wool (in this case just the inside cooking surface, don\\'t bother scrubbing the outside) or the self-clean cycle of your oven.I have to clarify something for those of you who are new to cast iron:  this will NOT match the performance of true \"non stick\" cookware.\\nBut it will cook nicer (than the cheap stuff anyway), and will last longer than 100 of those non-stick pieces put together (literally, not exaggerating, cast iron cookware can last for well over 100 years if not abused too badly).\\nAnd it looks great!Cast iron holds heat.\\nIt doesn\\'t respond quickly to temperature changes, so don\\'t get the pan too hot and try to save the food by lowering the heat.\\nIt won\\'t work.ALWAYS PREHEAT your cast iron before putting food in.\\nI never use more than 1 tsp oil or other fat in my pans when cooking, and that is already a lot, I often use less.How to season it:I\\'m going to depart from the norm and advise against oven-seasoning.\\nBecause the times I\\'ve done it it has failed on me eventually (seasoning flaked off), it takes ages, and it wastes a lot of energy.What I recommend you do instead, is similar to what the Chinese and the French recommend you do in cast iron/carbon steel cookware (and they really know what they\\'re doing when it comes to food and cookware).\\nThen wipe the lard out with a tissue or towel, let it smoke for half a minute, wipe again with the oily tissue to coat the pan again, all the time maintaining the high heat.\\nUse about 3-4 pieces of lard, then finally wipe the pan dry with a clean tissue, let it heat for another minute or so, then turn off the heat and let it cool.I did this method then tried frying an egg with a little bit of butter, zero stick.\\nLove this pan for eggs and smaller items like garlic cloves, chopped onions, etc..It\\'s held up well, just be sure you know how to care for it.\\nLodge has my confidence and it has been sustained by using their cast iron pans.\\nI don\\'t often need to cook in cast iron, but when I do, I want a great pan.\\nSo I choose Lodge pans as they are simply the best.\\nIt is pre-seasoned, and does a terrific job when cooking chicken or ribs or almost anything.\\nNothing can beat the Lodge Cast Iron Cookware.\\nI live alone and this 8&#34; cast iron skillet is the perfect size pan for me.\\nit is a great size pan and an absolute powerhouse workhorse for the kitchen.\\nI just keep it clean, dry, and oiled at all times.\\nfrom there you should be able to clean it out easily with a cast iron brush.\\nPre-seasoning on this skillet was kind of a joke.\\nI\\'m a complete newbie to iron skillets, so I didn\\'t understand this.\\nWe use it to make fried chicken, cook bacon, make gravy and all sorts of other wonderful things.\\nThe fact that it\\'s 12 inches makes it large enough to cook a good amount of food when entertaining others.We are quite pleased with our purchase and as a young couple trying to learn all the new cooking techniques we can, this was a great addition to our arsenal of pots and pans!\\nI had always wanted a cast-iron skillet.\\nI had always wanted a cast-iron skillet.\\nI like the way it cooks and how surprisingly easy it is to clean!\\nIf you are unfamiliar with Cast Iron Cooking see all the tips for cleaning so you don\\'t ruin the value of the original Seasoning.\\nAdd the salads and what a great meal.I also use [2]  10&#34; pans for individual pizza.\\nWhen you know how to use a cast iron skillet properly, it is one of the best cooking tools you will ever use.Cons:- Heavy- Handle gets hot- Must be cleaned and seasoned properly- Can break (or may break something) if dropped- Not good for boiling water- Not dishwasher safePros:- Lasts a lifetime (or several) with proper care (far longer than any other nonstick pan)- Excellent nonstick surface- Non toxic- A source of iron in your food (it\\'s good for you!)- Can use in oven or on stove opt- Easily recycled if it breaks (it is solid iron)- Works well on induction stove tops- Great for the environment (sustainable)- Usually cleans easily with little or no soap (!)- Much less expensive compared to many alternativesFor me the benefits far outweigh the costs.\\nGreat for steaks, eggs, potatoes, and anything that needs a good sear.\\nYou simply cannot substitute anything else for a good cast iron skillet.\\nAnother quality Lodge cast iron product.\\nGreat for cooking bacon, sausage, steak.Came well seasoned and getting more so with each use.Handle is a little too short.\\nAfter many replacement non-stick pans I finally learned how to use a cast iron pan and love them.\\nThey are better than all the fancy non-stick pans I\\'ve purchased in the past.\\nI make eggs, omelets, pancakes, steaks, pork chops, cornbread, you name it, I make it in the cast iron skillets.\\nI\\'ve compared this with a Calphalon professional non-stick pan side by side making pan cakes and the iron pan cooks faster at a lower temperature because the pan holds heat so much better.\\nIt\\'s great for frittata because after the stovetop, I just stick it in the pre-heated oven to firm up the top.\\nNice little cast Iron pan.\\n(Dont have to use a lot of oil.) Word of advice, get a handle mitt because the pan is small and moves around a lot.\\nOnce you use it a few times with oil, and clean and oil it up enough, it is stick free.\\n(Apple pie is great baked in the cast iron.) I use it once a day or multiple times a day.\\nSimply run under hot water and if necessary wipe out with a steel wool.I have a few different sized pans, as well as a variety of seasoned and unseasoned.By far this 10\" is the best.\\nI would heat it up (outside on my portable burner) until glowing white/gray (which I thought would burn the seasoning off!), and then throw my steak in--it would smoke like mad and the meat would turn BLACK (love blackened steaks!) But this did wonderful things for the seasoning--the interior became glossy smooth and good Lord, nowadys I used this skillet for everything from scrambled eggs to veggies--nothing STICKS in the least and the flavor is incredible!\\nEveryday hard use and abuse is what REAL seasoning is about!___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I had to buy this online, because good luck trying to find this size in any retail store...!\\nThe tiny 8\" (with a 6\" cooking surface) is everywhere, as is the 10.5\" (which I have and love), but this size is perfect for a single steak or small meals for one person.\\nI like blackened steaks, getting the pan beyond searing hot, and so this is a great little dedicated steak pan that I can get so hot it almost carbonizes the seasoning off, and I don\\'t have to worry about using it for anything else.\\nHowever that hasn\\'t happened yet, despite getting the pan up to 850F  over a high BTU gas burner, and having some incredible steaks (with lots of black smoke!) Kudos to Lodge for a very well done pre-seasoning process.This pan did come with some noticable and unsightly cast iron crap (over-spill) from the casting process, attached to the top lip in one area.\\nHowever the pan is so easy to use since it is Pre-seasoned, and been so useful for my steak cooking (and I have even scrambled eggs with no sticking), that I forgive Lodge the cosmetic blemishes even though I paid full retail + shipping.The logic Pre-seasoned line is really that good.\\nYou will still need to season it slowly, over time, for it to be like our grandmothers age-old seasoning was like on their Griswolds and Wagners, but it\\'s a great start.For frying and searing, cast iron just cannot be beat.\\nPlus the Lodge products (flawed as they may be) are really superior to many of the cheaper cast iron pans coming in from China (that are pre-seasoned or coated with God-knows-what!\\nLook what they did with pet food!) This skillet is big and heavy.\\nWe use it once every couple of weeks but when we need it it works fine.\\nThis is replacing our large non-stick skillet and is working out well other than needing a lid, nothing we have will fit.\\nI bought this to do high heat cooking that I did not want to do in my All Clad pans.\\nThe pre-seasoned finish also works well.\\nA great pan for the money.\\nLodge is THE name brand for cast iron skillets in the United States.\\nIt has worked perfectly so far, I will take care of it, and I expect to get many years of good use out of this pan.\\nThis is the cast iron pan I go to for most of my skillet needs, good size and great performance.\\nSeason it regularly, clean it with water (no soap) and a cast iron scrubber, and keep it oiled.\\nLove this frying pan from Lodge.\\nI also have a 10&#34; and 12&#34; cast iron pan for my collection.\\nI highly recommend Cooks great, no sticking, seasoned well!\\nShe cooks everything in her skillet!\\nI bought the 12\" Cast Iron skillet on Amazon and was honestly a little concerned with what kind of quality I would be getting because the price was so low.I love this skillet!\\nIt\\'s really a perfect cast iron skillet.\\nIt\\'s really a perfect cast iron skillet.\\nI am constantly destroying my skillets and thought cast iron might be smart for me.\\nIf this thing can stand up to me, it can stand up to anything!I now realize I do need to improve my upper body strength :)  The Lodge 12\" Skillet is very, very heavy.\\nIf it didn\\'t have the extra handle, I would not be able to lift this pan at all.Awesome quality, great price, smart design - of all the items in my kitchen, this pan is my favorite.\\nThese skillets need additional seasoning for their full cooking potential.\\nInstead of baking the skillets for hours, just fry  foods in them 2 or 3 times...chicken, fries, fish or  stir fry with oil.\\nAfter frying in it just once, the skillet will turn completely black and gets better with each subsequent use.Excellent quality cast iron.\\nThis size also makes a  wonderful deep dish pizza pan.\\nCook everything in it and nothing stick.\\nBut I make sure to always season after each use, as suggested by some of the reviews.\\nCleaning was a bit different from non-stick.\\nSeemed easy to clean, but needed oiling.\\nSecond time didn\\'t use dishsoap (Ew?) and it came out perfect.\\nI\\'d seen some cast iron in stores and didn\\'t much like what I saw.\\nWhen I got this item, the cooking surface was smooth and ready.\\nI fully intend to get a couple of other cast iron items from this seller / manufacturer.\\nI had recently spent $50 and was so dissapointed with another brand .Update------------------------------I\\'m still loving my cast Iron pan its been over a year now and I just wanted togive 2 tidbits of advice.\\nI have found butter to be better than oil for keeping the pan seasoned.\\nI do wash my pan with a sponge with very diluted soap then I set it over the stove and light the fire for 2 min this drys out the pan to prevent rust and then I add a little butter just when I turn off the flame.I use a paper towl and carefully wipe the butter around the hot pan.\\nI have one of the Lodge Miniature cast iron spoon rests that I cook with  on a routine basis.\\nAnd cast iron is easy to clean and maintain.\\nThey go crazy for them.Absolutely nothing cooks like cast iron.\\nI have returned it and will try ordering one again to see if I can get a good one.I\\'m leary of skillets shipped by Amazon though.\\nGreat for frying chicken, bacon, hash browns, eggs - you name it.\\nLots of great cast iron skillet recipes on the Lodge website too.\\nI have a very old pan that is like glass and expect this one to get there eventually.\\nThis skillet from Lodge is truly \"pre-seasoned\" and performs as advertized.\\nThis cast iron fry pan arrived in excellent shape and it was well packaged.\\nCast iron never goes bad.\\nI also have a 15\" Lodge skillet, and I love that for large roasts or just feeding a large crew.\\nAnd yes you can use cast iron on ceramic cooktops.\\nI recommend using 2 hands when moving the big 15\" pan.\\nI always wanted a cast iron skillet like my \"nanny\" had-her burgers & steak were always the best.\\nThis is perfecct- reasonably priced- small but large enough for a \"1 person meal\" and PRE-SEASONED...It\\'s great!\\nI am ready to ditch my all-clad non-stick pans, and this is the perfect replacement.\\nSince this pan comes pre seasoned, it took very little effort but to wash it according to the directions and begin using it right away.\\nI\\'ve already used it to cook scrambled and fried eggs, make pancakes, sear shrimp and steak, saute vegetables, and make a cream sauce.\\nSince the pan is so heavy, I just leave it on my stove, and in doing so, it\\'s what I use for whatever I cook.\\nI\\'ve only had one instance where my food stuck, and that was because I failed to heat up the pan enough and add enough oil.\\nIt beats all my $100+ all clad non-stick and stainless steel pans, but ten years ago when I bought those pans there were no preseason cast iron pans available for someone like me incapable of properly seasoning it myself.\\nMy husband likes to fry bacon and morel mushrooms and he missed using an iron skillet.\\nMuch to his delight I works just fine, heats up evenly and came well seasoned so we could use it right out of the box.\\nThis is great for kids who love to cook.\\nAlso, the glue that sticks the instructions card to the skillet came out well as if it was a non-stick pan (Somewhere in some lodge reviews, I read that the glue was scoured out of the pan causing discoloration).And GUESS WHAT......I got it for FREE....YES, as part of the 4-for-3 promotion.\\nThat\\'s the best thing about this skillet.\\nbut it takes awhile for the food to stop sticking, other wise I recommend, nice and sturdy, not too heavy, just the right size for single meals.\\nI bought three of these pans here on Amazon.\\nAnd the preseasoning is good, doesn\\'t need to be scrubbed off like others (although yes, I do heat my pans up before cooking - read the instructions that come with it) just heavy cooks great clean up is easy and the  lid fits perfecttly i ould recommend it for everyone :) This \"seasoned\" pan is sensational.\\nI size my pans to my cooktop burner size and the heat distribution is perfect.\\nI use this pan almost daily.\\nTried the other day, guess I lost my original pan, they just didn\\'t cook good, so I went to Amazon...wham they were there.\\nmy perfect little fried egg pan (or small amount of veggies, sausage, w/e)can\\'t wait to make some cornbread in it!\\nThis skillet is perfection in my kitchen.\\nI\\'ve owned cast iron skillets before, but they were always hand-me-downs and I wanted one that I had started from new, so when I got my skillet for my birthday last year, I was thrilled.Even though it came \"pre seasoned\", I still went the extra step and seasoned it some more.\\nThe result is that I can cook stuff in it and very little of it sticks...and if it does, it\\'s not so bad I can\\'t get it off with a bare minimum of work.And everything just tastes better after being cooked in a cast iron skillet...fried eggs, chicken, grilled cheese, etc.After use, I bring it over to the sink and run it, still hot, under very hot water and scrub with a long handled scrub brush made for this purpose.\\nOnce dry, I pour in a bit of vegetable oil, swish it around with a paper towel, and wipe up the excess and hang it on my pot rack till next time.Another way of cleaning is to let it cool, put water in, heat on the stove and then transfer it all to the sink where, again, using very hot water and no soap, I scrub the bits out.\\nI then allow it to dry on the burner (turned off) and reseason with oil when it\\'s dry.I know it sounds like a lot of work, but really, it\\'s much quicker and easier than some of my other pots and pans...even the so-called \"non-stick\" ones.I love the weight of it and the feeling of durability...properly cared for, these things should probably last a hundred years or more.\\nYears ago I \\'upgraded\\' (young me, then) and got rid of my cast iron cooking pans, and for years I\\'ve been sorry, but didn\\'t want to spend more money re-purchasing.\\nSomething finally made me decide to buy this one - partially because these days all the pans are pre-seasoned, and partially because this one was made in USA.\\nI\\'ve used it a few times so far, and find it is really better than my old pan, and I\\'m a happy (older and wiser?) person.\\nI just started getting into cast iron cooking and it is much better than anything else I have used.\\nI only have one old cast iron skillet and it is much smoother than these but I assume over time these will get much much better.\\nI cooked a lot of bacon in mine before I attempted any eggs.\\nSeriously though, this is a great skillet.\\nHamburger tastes better than a normal pan and most anything tastes better and cooks better on the skillet.\\nThis might help with some extra iron in your diet if you\\'re anemic.Cleaning: Clean immediately after use with soap and a sponge.\\nThen oil the whole thing with any type of cooking oil with a light coat.\\nWe use a lot of cast iron in our house and I bought this one because my 12 inch was just a little over kill for most jobs.\\nThis pan is great for a few pieces of bacon and eggs in the morning and many other jobs where I really don\\'t need a large pan.\\nNeed to cook bacon or other fatty foods in it to help with the surface to achieve a good non stick status.\\nI render my own lard and use it on many saut&eacute;ing projects which helps to get my pans up to the level I like them I think everyone already knows that these are 5 star products.\\nIf you don\\'t love cast iron, then you don\\'t know how to cook.\\nIf anyone ever tells you they love their skillet, it\\'s probably cast iron.\\nYou can let grease from bacon and other fatty meats just sit in it, and then cook with that grease next time around.\\nSeems like this is one of the only cast iron brands that you can buy, they\\'ve done it right!\\nThis pan was larger than I had expected, it\\'s a great size.\\nI can see it being perfect for doing fish, pork chop sandwiches, or any other kind of masculine food that I eat.A+++++++ I use this tiny little skillet almost daily during the winter to quickly melt small amounts of coconut oil.\\n(Coconut oil turns solid anytime the temperature falls below the high 60s.) I picked it up at whole foods and thought it would be perfect for melting butter in after making stove-top pop corn and it is.\\nI liked the small shall size because my other melting pan was too deep at 2 cups.\\nSeasoning a cast iron pan yourself is really easy.\\nI like to season my cast iron pans with coconut oil given the chance.\\nThis skillet is by far the busiest pan in my kitchen.\\nI use it daily.I love to cook, and this skillet is so versatile.\\nI am cooking for two, but this skillet will easily accommodate more.\\nPlus, if you love to cook, but don\\'t have a large family, I urge you to get this large skillet.\\nHandy smaller cast iron pan for the oven...Great to make that smaller meal all in one pan when I bake in the oven...Used by restaurants for single servings a lot too....The best for mac & cheese...gooey buns...and any single serving...The cast iron pan takes a few minutes to heat up before you start to avoid sticking messes when used on the stove top...and clean up easy just wash it out while it is hot the food usually slides off...then re-season the pan with oil while it is still warm and it is ready for the next use....Makes great corn bread too....Eggs this is just the right pan...No real draw backs it is a small cast iron pan what more can be said..\\nI use this skillet for cooking bacon and most of my meat.\\nThis skillet is so good it makes me cook more often.\\nI have never been more happy with a $10 purchase in my lifetime.You will need to season the skillet, or any new cast iron skillet, yourself.\\nI primarily bought cast iron cookware to escape Teflon, but I found that it\\'s been a fun addition to our kitchen.\\nThough it requires grease, I find seasoned cast-iron just as non-stick as Teflon.\\nI sometime get little bits that stick in the pan, but the cleanup is easy enough.\\nSo potatoes, rice, pasta, etc, need to be cooked in a different pan.\\nAcidic foods, like tomato sauce, will take the seasoning off.\\nI stick to eggs, meats, veggies, and pancakes in this pan, with no complaints.\\nI had mine for over a year and it cooks everything great.\\nSome people complain that it is not as smooth as an old Griswold or Wagner which is true since I also own a few of these skillets but with added seasoning they even out nicely.\\nLodge products are a great value on Amazon and over the past year I bought the 5 qt Dutch oven (which I love), round griddle (makes the best pancakes), square grill pan and fajita set.\\nCleans beautifully, preseasoned, just the right size, and it comes with the hot handle!\\nJust wiped it down after use, and oiled it again.\\nGreat size for baking or frying.\\nI don\\'t know what I would do with out this Pan The LODGE-LOGIC 12 inch Pre-Seasoned, is the one I use the most, it came Pre-Seasoned so I didn\\'t have to do anything to it, is the Pan I reach for when I\\'m about to fry or cook anything and nothing sticks to it, and it suppose to be healthier for you.\\nI wash it by hand, Towel dry and do not use any Soap or Detergent and sometimes while is warm I wipe a light coat of vegetable oil all over it; I want to keep building the non-stick surface.\\nThank You I did the inside and outside surfaces with lard and placed it in the oven upside down for 1 hour at 350 Deg. F., I only wash it in hot water when cleaning it and put in on the stove after drying it out, turn the burner on for 3 Min., apply peanut oil all around the indide of the pan and it\\'s ready to use again with no rust forming.\\nI use it for frying single eggs, and melting butter.\\nI don\\'t cook mini/novelty foods, but it would be great for that.\\nIt takes up no space, it is indestructible if you keep it dry, and it is just right for a few things.Cast iron is great stuff.\\nWhen properly cared for, it is the original non-stick, with no weird industrial chemicals.These pans will outlive you, and they are made in the USA.\\nI kept hearing the statement that cast iron was \"the original non-stick pan\".I used this pan to cook some eggs after I bought it with horrible results.Then, I started cooking meats (steak pork chops, etc) in it.\\nThe more I used it after that, the more everything slid off of it like it was made of glass.This pan has a permanent spot on top of my stove now.\\nWhat\\'s more, it\\'s the most reliable pan I have that goes from stove-top to oven, and back.The other great thing about it is that you can bring it along with your dutch oven on your camping trips to cook over an open fire/coals.As far as the heft (weight) of this thing goes, if anyone doesn\\'t understand what cast iron is all about, they shouldn\\'t be buying it.\\nFirst I lightly oiled with veggie oil and baked 1 hour to make sure it was ready to use.To make cornbread:------------------------------Heat pan on stove (medium high heat), add2 TBSP of real butter to melt the butter.\\nPour in the cornbread batter, remove from stove and bake as directed.For some reason the cast iron makes a great crust on the cornbread.This pan is just the right size for cornbread.\\nIts heavy, but if you can handle the weight, its prefect size for steaks.10-12inch is ok for one or 2 small pieces, 15inch is prefect and also retain heat better per the big mass.\\nCast iron is perfect for making a great steak in your home.\\nIt evenly heats the steak and allows you to sear in the flavor.Some note about the skillet:Its large and heavy, many people will need two hands to move it.\\nYou cant beat this price for a seasoned skillet.\\nI also bought a cook book for it and it came with tips on keeping this guy seasoned and how to cook better with it since Im kind of a goon at why these are better than other pans.\\nMeat and vegetables browned on the cast iron skillet taste way better that from the non stick pan.\\nThis skillet was well seasoned out of the box, so we only have to keep covering it inside with a thin film of oil after each use.The 13.25 inch size is perfect, we can reuse the lid we had for our non stick 13 inch pan.The silicone handles help a lot, because the thing is heavy.\\nI grew up using cast iron skillets.\\nWhat a pleasure to cook with this little skillet.\\nBefore purchasing this, my only cast iron was the 12 inch skillet, but, because of its size, I hardly ever used it.\\nIt weighs 100 pounds and the cooking surface looks like an asphalt parking lot.But THIS little beauty is the perfect size and weight for cooking for one.\\nAccording to another reviewer, Joe Bob (Lodge Logic L8SK3 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet), if your skillet feels a little sticky or tacky and food sticks, it\\'s because it wasn\\'t seasoned at a high enough temp so the first thing I did was wash this with a drop of dish washing liquid and add to the pre-seasoning.\\nOf course, as y\\'all know (and now I know), the real selling point for cast iron cooking is that food tastes 100% better.\\n:-) This pan is the perfect size for people who like to back pack or camp.\\nJust use warm water and a light scrubing pad to make sure the pan stays seasoned.\\nIts a little heavy to carry, but worth it if you like cooking anything in it.\\nAfter loving the performance of myLodge Logic Dutch Oven with loop handles, I knew the next thing I wanted to pick up was a good-sized cast iron skillet.\\nI own a few cast iron pans inherited from my grandma, but they were all on the smaller size and I wanted something that could handle a couple of steaks side-by-side.This 12-inch Skillet is a bit of a monster, heavy to wield and almost unmanageable once it is down on the stove, but it delivers some great flavor.\\nEven though I love my Calphalon non-stick pans as well, for putting a crust on a seared steak cast iron can\\'t be beat.\\nPlus, it can go straight off the stove top into the oven for a nice quick finish of the middle.\"Lodge Logic\" puts out really nice cast iron cookware, at a reasonable price.\\nTake everyone\\'s advice on seasoning it, and you will have a pan for a lifetime.\\nyou can easily cook 5 pounds of ground beef at a time in it (with room to stir!), and because it\\'s cast iron, even tho it\\'s much bigger than my burner, it cooks pretty evenly.\\nhighly recommend This is a great item to use at home or to take along with you on your camping trips.\\nI have a 15&#34; lodge skillet and this one is a great deal smaller, obviously lol, but its PERFECT for customizing pasta sauces, making a few eggs at a time, if using more than 3 id say get a larger size.\\nI use this skillet every week.'"

       "'I\\'ve always bought the regular Lodge skillets and loved them.\\nWent with the pre-seasoned this time because I wanted this size.Wow, what a pain.\\n(Then I seasoned by coating with oil and heating in the oven for 20 minutes.I\\'m still wary of that residue.\\nNever have I seen (and smelled) so much rust (trapped UNDER the coating) come off a skillet--new or badly stored in a garage.\\nBeen using good old American-made Lodge skillets for years, plus we regularly use a big cast iron wok imported from China.So, I\\'m giving only two stars because the pre-seasoning is a messy hassle.Now I\\'ve got to cook dinner.\\nI\\'m not a cook and didn\\'t know what cast iron cooked like.\\nI hate cooking in it because the eggs stick like crazy.\\nWife informed me i\\'m an idiot and she bought me a nice teflon pan for my eggs!\\nI saw this at walmart for a dollar cheaper.If you know how to cook with this i\\'m sure it\\'s an ok pan.\\nI own over a dozen Lodge Cast item pieces that I\\'ve happily used for many years and recently purchased this one to add to my collection.\\nOn the first use before heating, I noticed the pan bottom was warped upward in the center allowing oil and food to run to the edge.\\nI\\'ve NEVER had a problem with Lodge cast iron until now.\\nIt\\'s an amusing novelty, and I\\'ve toasted spices in it, but apart from gratuitous cuteness, or maybe creative serving ideas, there\\'s no reason to bother with a skillet this small.\\ngave it away as a gift .May be beautifull to use the skillet on the outside Grill in your Garden .\\nBut inside the kitchen : no thanks.I am not living in stone age and kitchens filled with smoke .I returned imeadetely to my All Clad ,Calphalon non stick and Demeyere skillets enjoying the 21.\\nI love cast iron pans, but this one warped quickly with a high spot in the middle.\\nWhy would Lodge think Amazon would want a cracked skillet?\\nWhy would Amazon think I would want a cracked skillet?\\nThe cooking surface has a \"rough\" texture which causes food to stick unnecessarily, whereas it should have been ground smooth before leaving the factory.\\nThe \"loop\" handle was a good idea, otherwise most folks would likely strain their wrists trying to lift this pan off the stove with one hand.\\nAnyone who says they\\'re satisfied with this item has never used a good quality iron fry pan.\\nWe decided to got for an iron skillet like grandma used to use.\\nWhe you fry anything breaded, the breading sticks to the sandy surface (no matter how much butter you use).\\nAnd when I do give it a good scrubbing cause I can\\'t stand the idea of cooking while there\\'s old food bits still imbedded in the cooking surface,  then I must reseason it.Ok Ok bacon should be a safe bet.\\nIt has a Martian landscape of micro-rust.I must admit we gave it a wholehearted attempt and really wanted to transition to iron, but it didn\\'t work out at all.\\nAs heavy as is pan is the bottom is too thin to evenly spread the heat to the edges unless you own a commercial kitchen stove like wolf or viking, I bought this pan to fry bacon with the pieces of raw bacon would cook in the middle but all the pieces 3 inches from the edge would not even begin to cook forcing me to move the pieces around which is more trouble than it\\'s worth.\\nGreat size.I seasoned this Castiron skillet 4 times, at 400 degrees,for a hour each time.I still was not happy with it.Two times with bacon grease.\\nTwo times with organic Coconut oil.I guess I was expecting it to be like my old Griswold castiron.To me, it will never be like the old skillets.I saut&eacute;ed/fried sliced potatoes with coconut oil, and they stucked.\\nI tried a egg, which wasa big mistake also.I find this pan very heavy compared to my old Castiron pans.\\nIt is also a thicker castiron then the old skillets,which are not as heavy.Maybe I did something wrong, but the pan said it was pre-seasoned, and I seasoned it.The in side is very lumpy, and I could not get it smooth..\\nI did NOT wash it with soap.I really did not like this pan, and sent it back.\\nEven left on the cooktop for 15 minutes to try to heat evenly, the outside in about a 1 inch thick ring basically did not get hot at all.\\nAnd I think it is cheaper than most pizza pans, so that\\'s not bad (though a pizza pan will likely have a straight side, and this is sloped slightly).If you have a super large cooking surface.\\nI haven\\'t gotten the 12&#34; cast iron, but I think it would work for me, given the 1&#34; ring mentioned above.\\nThat something was a frying pan whose middle would not bow up causing oil or butter to flow to the edges.\\nI had been extraordinarily careful not to expose the pan to rapid temperature changes, yet the middle did bow up.I also thought that given enough mass in the bottom, heat distribution over an 8\" glass-top burner wouldn\\'t be an issue for cooking pancakes, etc.\\nIf I NEED or want even heat over more than an 8\" disk, I might have to acquire an electric griddle or skillet.\\nI have moved on to cooking pancakes one-at-a-time and stir-frying using my non-stick wok.Cast iron holds a huge amount of heat and that has implications for your cooking.\\nWith this pan, I\\'d have to guess when to turn off the burner, because it would keep on cooking for a few minutes after.\\nUltimately, this vessel was not a candidate for my style of cooking which needs responsive control of heat going to my food.Mine weighed 6 lb 11 oz.\\nI only then read other reviews mentioning these skillets arriving with cracks in them.\\nI\\'m still in disbelief that a cast-iron skillet was damaged so drastically without even being used.\\nI could not get this pan to stop from rusting&#8230;I actually bought two of these and had the same problem till I call it quits.\\nWhatever this pan comes \"per-seasoned\" with, it does not keep me from having to violently scrape food off of it every time I cook.\\nDon\\'t make the mistake i made and buy this cheap cast iron skillet.\\nThe pan doesn\\'t heat consistently, the surface is uneven( meaning vegetable oil will go to one side, and everything sticks to it.\\nAnd to top that off it creates a hot spot right in the middle and the edges of the pan are cold.\\nYou need to basically fill the pan up with enough oil so your frying your food.\\nI love the cast iron aspects of it, but frankly the heat distribution of this pan is one of the worst I have seen in quite a while.\\nHowever, the center heats up to the point of burning while the outside edges of the pan are too cool to cook in a decently short amount of time.I really wanted to like this pan but honestly...I\\'m thinking about returning it...\\nI own a well seasoned steel Wok, 2 cast iron griddles and one small #3 Wagner cast iron skillet.\\nJust some coarse kosher salt and cold or hot water removes any oils or sticky sauces.The box that contained the Lodge skillet felt light.\\nThe replacement came quickly and I am supposed to get a credit for my shipping costs.I augmented the alleged \"pre-seasoned\" lodge skillet in the manner I was shown by a chef who was trained by the renowned French chef Escoffier.\\nUsing a paper napkin or towel or cotton cloth will place fibers in the patina and they will create a place for food to adhere to.A teaspoon of Canola (Rapeseed) oil was put in the hot pan and then an egg followed.\\nThe egg stuck better than Crazy Glue and this did not surprise me, as I was suspicious of the pan when I saw it had a surface that looked like it had actually been cast in sand (which is still a way to cast iron.)My old, above mentioned, treasures all have surfaces as smooth as a baby\\'s bottom.\\nAfter the abyssmal performance I felt I had nothing to loose by messing with the surface so I tried to smooth out the pebbled (sand cast) surface but gave it up as I lack the proper materials to do so.Nonetheless, I think I may have abraded the so-called pre-seasoned surface enough to lay down my own patina that may smooth out with constant use.\\nOtherwise, I will just use the skillet for frying things other than eggs or pancakes, etc.\\nI saw a similar pan in large chain retailer for less money.A few days after posting my 1 star review I scrubbed the surface and seasoned the pan in a manner similar to that used by an earlier poster.\\nThis time the pan was not very hot.\\nI recommend this pan even though the cooking surface is not evenly flat and mine had a crease in it as well.I purchased my first Teflon pan in 1970 and it performed awesomely for almost 10 years.\\nI have never seen a coated pan that performed as well as the first one I purchased.\\nI just tossed a coated Calphalon skillet that started to stick after 3 years of careful use.\\nMy wife would not let me use anything but a special plastic spatula or wooden spoon so it was not abused.Ken BatesBoston I am a Big Fan of Lodge Logic Cast Iron Pans so I was expecting this one to be just as good as the \"original\".\\nImmediately upon inspecting my brand new pre-seasoned pan, I noticed that flakes of the \"non-stick\" coating had scratched off during transit.\\nI know it\\'s supposed to be convenient but if I were you, I would order the \"Lodge Original Finish 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet\".\\nIt\\'s not that hard to season it and it\\'s much, much better than the coating they use on their pre-seasoned pans.\\nAlso, a 12-inch is much more useful than the 10.5 inch pan.\\nI\\'ve used this pan to make a single egg (the reason I wanted something this small) and even though it is \"preseasoned\" I\\'ve always pammed it and preheated it and the eggs still stick to the bottom.\\nWhat am I doing wrong?I thought these pans were non-stick?BTW, eventhough my batter burned up in the pan, I cleaned up the pan in a snap!Took less than 1 minute to rinse with hot water.Also ...\\nIt won\\'t scratch up the pan?Edit: (May 14, 2012)I pre-seasoned my pan, and made stir-fry today.YUMMY!!This is restaurant quality!LOVE this pan!Edit: November 25, 2012I\\'m leaving my ORIGINAL review in tact, so that people can see, I DID love this pan.7 months later, it RUSTED.\\nI\\'d give it NO stars, if I could.Frankly, I don\\'t think it\\'s healthy cooking food in RUST.Nasty.This is not like the old-fashioned cast iron pan my mother used.\\nThere are just too many \"do\\'s n\\' Don\\'ts\" with this pan.Don\\'t leave a lid/cover on it.Be sure it is completely dry.It if gets RUSTY, sand it down and pre-season AGAIN.Blah, blah, blah.Too much to know.\\nAfter 3 months of light use, some kind of flaw in the bottom of the pan exploded while it was on an electric burner.\\nThe little explosion blew an eighth-inch deep divot out of the bottom of the pan, which was powerful enough to also damage the electric heating element.If it had happened in the top surface of the pan instead of the bottom, the user could have been seriously harmed.I have several Lodge pans that are 30 or more years old, and this is the first time I have ever experienced this.Has Lodge reduced its quality control lately ?I will not replace the damaged pan with another Lodge product.\\nAs the title says, maybe I\\'m just doing something wrong, but I can\\'t seem to get this thing properly seasoned.\\nWhatever I try and cook in this sticks like crazy, and it\\'s just an all around pain compared to my other pans.\\nIn theory I love this skillet, but in practice I almost never even try to use it anymore.\\nI love the concept but it just didnt work for me.Everything sticks, even after I seasoned it, put in oven, cool it down reseason it, over 3 times ...\\nIt still stick.My mistake was also that I used it to make acidic food (like tomato sauce), I had no idea and the dish came out tasting odd.I guess this pan is just good to sautee some chicken with onions or to make a steak aybe?\\nI need to dry it with a towel right after use to keep it from rusting.\\nlolit is like the other pans and skillets but its tiny.\\nif you are looking for that it would be great for you, I have read a number of positive reviews and decided to buy this pan (the first cast-iron pan i my life).\\nEven with a good care of the pan (I followed the instructions of care), it got rust after being used for a week.\\nIt is really hard to clean because food stick to it.\\nMy two star rating is not about the skillet, which I never used, but about Amazon\\'s inferior shipping container that could not protect even a piece of cast iron from terminal damage.Lodge Logic L14SK3 15-Inch Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet Firstly it was my bad not to look at the introduction carefully so that I was a little shocked by how heavy this cast iron skillet is.\\nI thought I could still deal with it and use it.But It\\'s just not non-stick.\\nOil first, heat it, then food in.I\\'m very disappointed.\\nI seasoned the skillet a couple times myself with olive oil at 500 F for an hour and have had great performance so far.\\nIt is my first cast iron pan, so I did my research...\\nAfter using it, I think everyone should have a good old handy cast iron skillet in their kitchen.***UPDATE***So...\\nMaybe I can scrap it all off and re-season the cast iron.\\nThe pre-seasoning is presumably intended to counter the fact that the inside surface is left unsmoothed, perhaps to reduce production costs.\\nHowever, on the unsmooth surface, pre-seasoning did not reduce sticking.\\nLodge had a very good name in the industry for a long time.\\nIt was ok at first, though it was a little bit small.It started to rust on the inside some time ago, which I don\\'t like at all.\\nIt\\'s about 2 years old, but it\\'s been rusting a little at a time for a while.I plan to buy a stainless steel skillet to replace it the next chance I get.\\nI bought this hoping to get it well seasoned so that I could use it without non stick spray or oil.\\nEven after using it repeatedly, it never got seasoned enough, and it also started to develop rust spots.\\nI love the idea of cast iron skillets, especially when I see them used in cookbooks, but maybe it\\'s because I\\'m not Southern, but I can\\'t seem to maintain a cast iron skillet, pre-seasoned or not.\\nYou have to keep it oiled often and even the tiniest drop of water will cause rust.\\nAfter one time use, although i coated with oil..it burned on the surface of the pan and I can\\'t get off  the food that sticks to the pan.\\nand it rusted and I smelled iron.\\nI got this because I need more iron, and I eat a lot of eggs.\\nI found the surface too rough to cook eggs and get them out of the pan.\\nYou would  have to float them on butter or oil to get them out of this pan.\\nBack to my non stick pan...I would take it camping, if I ever went camping.'"

imbedded in the cooking surface,  then I must reseason it.Ok Ok bacon should be a safe bet.\\nAs heavy as is pan is the bottom is too thin to evenly spread the heat to the edges unless you own a commercial kitchen stove like wolf or viking, I bought this pan to fry bacon with the pieces of raw bacon would cook in the middle but all the pieces 3 inches from the edge would not even begin to cook forcing me to move the pieces around which is more trouble than it\\'s worth.\\nIt is also a thicker castiron then the old skillets,which are not as heavy.Maybe I did something wrong, but the pan said it was pre-seasoned, and I seasoned it.The in side is very lumpy, and I could not get it smooth..\\nThat something was a frying pan whose middle would not bow up causing oil or butter to flow to the edges.\\nI had been extraordinarily careful not to expose the pan to rapid temperature changes, yet the middle did bow up.I also thought that given enough mass in the bottom, heat distribution over an 8\" glass-top burner wouldn\\'t be an issue for cooking pancakes, etc.\\nI have moved on to cooking pancakes one-at-a-time and stir-frying using my non-stick wok.Cast iron holds a huge amount of heat and that has implications for your cooking.\\nWhatever this pan comes \"per-seasoned\" with, it does not keep me from having to violently scrape food off of it every time I cook.\\nDon\\'t make the mistake i made and buy this cheap cast iron skillet.\\nThe pan doesn\\'t heat consistently, the surface is uneven( meaning vegetable oil will go to one side, and everything sticks to it.\\nYou need to basically fill the pan up with enough oil so your frying your food.\\nI love the cast iron aspects of it, but frankly the heat distribution of this pan is one of the worst I have seen in quite a while.\\nHowever, the center heats up to the point of burning while the outside edges of the pan are too cool to cook in a decently short amount of time.I really wanted to like this pan but honestly...I\\'m thinking about returning it...\\nThe replacement came quickly and I am supposed to get a credit for my shipping costs.I augmented the alleged \"pre-seasoned\" lodge skillet in

food to adhere to.A teaspoon of Canola (Rapeseed) oil was put in the hot pan and then an egg followed.\\nThe egg stuck better than Crazy Glue and this did not surprise me, as I was suspicious of the pan when I saw it had a surface that looked like it had actually been cast in sand (which is still a way to cast iron.)My old, above mentioned, treasures all have surfaces as smooth as a baby\\'s bottom.\\nAfter the abyssmal performance I felt I had nothing to loose by messing with the surface so I tried to smooth out the pebbled (sand cast) surface but gave it up as I lack the proper materials to do so.Nonetheless, I think I may have abraded the so-called pre-seasoned surface enough to lay down my own patina that may smooth out with constant use.\\nOtherwise, I will just use the skillet for frying things other than eggs or pancakes, etc.\\nI just tossed a coated Calphalon skillet that started to stick after 3 years of careful use.\\nMy wife would not let me use anything but a special plastic spatula or wooden spoon so it was not abused.Ken BatesBoston I am a Big Fan of Lodge Logic Cast Iron Pans so I was expecting this one to be just as good as the \"original\".\\nImmediately upon inspecting my brand new pre-seasoned pan, I noticed that flakes of the \"non-stick\" coating had scratched off during transit.\\nI know it\\'s supposed to be convenient but if I were you, I would order the \"Lodge Original Finish 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet\".\\nIt\\'s not that hard to season it and it\\'s much, much better than the coating they use on their pre-seasoned pans.\\nIt won\\'t scratch up the pan?Edit: (May 14, 2012)I pre-seasoned my pan, and made stir-fry today.YUMMY!!This is restaurant quality!LOVE this pan!Edit: November 25, 2012I\\'m leaving my ORIGINAL review in tact, so that people can see, I DID love this pan.7 months later, it RUSTED.\\nI\\'d give it NO stars, if I could.Frankly, I don\\'t think it\\'s healthy cooking food in RUST.Nasty.This is not like the old-fashioned cast iron pan my mother used.\\nThe little explosion blew an eighth-inch deep divot out of the bottom of the pan, which was powerful enough to also damage the electric heating element.If it had happened in the top surface of the pan instead of the bottom, the user could have been seriously harmed.I have several Lodge pans that are 30 or more years old, and this is the first time I have ever experienced this.Has Lodge reduced its quality control lately ?I will not replace the damaged pan with another Lodge product.\\nWhatever I try and cook in this sticks like crazy, and it\\'s just an all around pain compared to my other pans.\\nI love the concept but it just didnt work for me.Everything sticks, even after I seasoned it, put in oven, cool it down reseason it, over 3 times ...\\nIt still stick.My mistake was also that I used it to make acidic food (like tomato sauce), I had no idea and the dish came out tasting odd.I guess this pan is just good to sautee some chicken with onions or to make a steak aybe?\\nI seasoned the skillet a couple times myself with olive oil at 500 F for an hour and have had great performance so far.\\nAfter using it, I think everyone should have a good old handy cast iron skillet in their kitchen.***UPDATE***So...\\nMaybe I can scrap it all off and re-season the cast iron.\\nHowever, on the unsmooth surface, pre-seasoning did not reduce sticking.\\nIt was ok at first, though it was a little bit small.It started to rust on the inside some time ago, which I don\\'t like at all.\\nIt\\'s about 2 years old, but it\\'s been rusting a little at a time for a while.I plan to buy a stainless steel skillet to replace it the next chance I get.\\nI bought this hoping to get it well seasoned so that I could use it without non stick spray or oil.\\nAfter one time use, although i coated with oil..it burned on the surface of the pan and I can\\'t get off  the food that sticks to the pan.\\nI found the surface too rough to cook eggs and get them out of the pan.'"

       "'And another review complaining that the handle gets hot!  !If you are familiar with cast-iron, and are willing to give it the minimal care it requires, you\\'ll love this.  I enjoy using it, don\\'t mind caring for it, and appreciate the finished product only cast iron cooking delivers.  Lodge simply does not take the time anymore to proplery finish their pans.  A true cast iron pan is super smooth.  With proper seasoning (not the garbage spray lodge puts on) a nice piece of cast iron will be virtuly non-stick.  Lodge simply does not spend the time to finish their pans like they used to and the pans suffer now.  I added the layer of oil because I wasn\\'t sure if the &#34;pre seasoned&#34; would ruin my dinner or not.  I bought this, somewhat reluctantly, as what I at the time considered a poor replacement for a \"real\" grill.Now, obviously this isn\\'t exactly the same as grilling, but for some things - particularly lean steaks and pork chops, it does an excellent job.  In fact, after cooking my first fillet Mignon in this skillet I realized it\\'s actually better suited to this cut of meat than an outdoor grill - it leaves a perfectly seared, caramelized exterior and a nice red interior (just like I like it).  It also can also be used to fry up a pretty mean burger - but be warned, burgers, and other fattier cuts of meat, create a LOT of smoke when cooked indoors on this baby, even with a window cracked and the exhaust fan on (I cooked a ribeye a while back that left my apartment smelling like a bbq pit for like 3 days, it was worth it though).Cleaning it is easy.  I just get it hot (either by cleaning soon after using it or heating it up in the oven before cleaning) and scrub with some kosher salt and a paper towel, rinsing it out afterwards (and immediately wiping it off, I don\\'t leave it to dry as it could rust).In short - this thing is great, and well worth the price.  Works great on my induction stove, heats up fast and the food tastes wonderful.  You really can\\'t go wrong with Lodge Logic; it is seen as the top cast iron for a reason.  I would also recommend the griddle...it\\'s great.If you are going between the 10 and 12 inch pan...get the 12 there\\'s more room for a full steak.  My mother and mother-in-law both cook with skillets that have been well seasoned, and I\\'m very happy to achieve the same with mine.  I love using my Cast Iron skillets just love them.  From deep frying (nice heavy pan holds heat well), pan searing then putting the whole pan into the oven to roast and finish, to even baking!Do not use this for braising or say...\\nLodge has been making cast-iron for a long time and they make great products.  This is my first experience cooking with cast iron.  I will be buying more cast iron pans in the future.  The price is fantastic and the skillet is a great size.This is a necessity for any home chef.  The explosive flavor that this thing produces due all the yummy fats and sauces that have seeped into it are the best part, though.There are a few downsides of course: 1) It\\'s heavy as hell, 2) the handle gets too hot to hold without a mitten, 3) it takes a little bit longer to heat up than standard skillets that are thinner, 4) it\\'s kind of easy to burn your fingers on the edges of the skillet when you go to stir the food, and 5) I hear that you can ruin the skillet if you use soap to clean it.  We got this as a gift from our wedding registry.It\\'s solid, heavy, and it\\'s already taken a great deal of cooking, including stovetop to oven.We were so pleased with the way it cooked, we bought another as a gift to a friend.So far, no cracks, no breaks, no scratches, no defects.  I never cooked with cast iron so I can\\'t explain why, but I prefer using this lodge logic to my other nice cookware.My wife has made sure that I keep and clean it correctly when I use it, so it\\'s in perfect shape and cooks beautifully.  I had an ancient 8 inch cast iron skillet that has been in my family forever and it\\'s getting very pitted and food is sticking more and more.  I\\'d never cooked with one and found the idea of using something not coated in teflon pretty intimidating.Then, I got this Lodge cast iron skillet.  I rubbed on some bacon grease, popped the skillet into the oven, heated it for a while, took it out, let it cool, then repeated.  As the skillet becomes more seasoned over time, it smokes less.To clean my cast iron skillet, I pour avocado oil into it while it\\'s still warm and dump in some coarse sea salt.  I use a clean, lint-free cloth to scrub the oil and salt into the skillet, removing any cooked on food.  Then, I give it a good rinse in hot water and place the skillet into a hot oven until it is dry (quickly drying with heat avoids a build up of rust).  Once the skillet is dry, I pour in just a bit of oil and spread it around before storing the pan until the next use.With good care and a bit of effort, cast iron is a kitchen essential.  I wish I\\'d gotten a good cast iron skillet years ago, but I do enjoy making up for lost time!  This skillet is very heavy; the extra handle is there because you really do need to use it.  Regardless, this is a great cast iron piece to start with and you can\\'t beat the price!  They are heavy to handle but if you are buying a cast iron skillet, you know that anyway.  If you carefully examine most cast iron cookware, you will see some imperfections.The first three times I used my skillet, I re-seasoned it at 450 degrees.  The pre-seasoning done by Lodge is good for a foundation, but you should expect to improve upon it.  I do not use soap (although the Lodge website says that a small amount won\\'t hurt it) because my grandmother would roll over in her grave, if I did it.  I dry the skillet immediately and while it is still warm, spread extra virgin light olive oil on the pan (inside and out).  After an hour, I cut off the heat and let the oven (and the skillet) return to room temperature (don\\'t open the oven door, as the slower the heat drop, the better).  My grandmother got to a point when she only seasoned her pans two or three times per year.Also, I would prefer to use flax seed oil in the seasoning process, but, if you do your research, there are all sorts of debates on what type oil to use.  As a lover of cast iron this was a great piece.  I purchased it so as to use it in my toaster oven and it works great for that purpose.  Lodge Logic also makes a pan called the one egg wonder...\\nOne piece of bread fits perfectly so grilled cheeses, toasted sandwiches and the like are great here too, among other things.It fit the small burner on my electric stove perfectly.  It covers all of the coils so no uncovered heat and all the dangers that that implies.If you\\'re new to cast iron, as I am, make sure to use something when touching the handle.  I burned the first thing I tried to cook by using too high of a heat and not seasoning it first.  After washing, I put it on a medium heat, coat it lightly with oil using a paper towel, let it heat for a few minutes, then wipe it clean and cool it down before storing it again.  7 years later, I\\'m still using this same skillet; it has been reseasoned once or twice (to get progressively better seasoning), and is still going strong.A tip: the best seasoning process I\\'ve found to give a hard, slick surface is 5+ very thin coats of flax seed oil, wiping it off after apply the oil and before baking.  Best cast iron ever and with Amazon\\'s price...even better!  It never seasoned, was hard to clean and had hot spots all throughout that made cooking a chore.  This pan has virtually no hot spots, seasons well, as a result cleans like a dream.  It\\'s not the easiest to clean, since you can\\'t just throw it in the dish washer, but that\\'s with any cast iron skillet.  Some things don\\'t seem to cook as well in cast-iron but for the most part they\\'re both great.  This pan comes pre-seasoned, but it needs additional seasoning to become more non-stick.  Overall, I\\'m enjoying cooking with cast iron and this skillet seems perfect.  Love: after seasoned, I could cook anything in it without sticking!  I know it\\'s cast iron, I know, I know.....It makes stove top to oven cooking method quite challenging.  I am sure we will make good use out of this purchase for a long, long time.  Was looking at bacon presses for more money and saw a review saying they bought a press and ended up using a small cast iron pan instead.  Went to visit my daughter and noticed she only cooks in cast iron so I decided to give it a try.  I soak my pan in warm to hot water and use a soft to medium bristle brush to get food off.  I never leave it wet- I dry it off by putting on gas stove and add some oil so its ready for my next use.  Before I start cooking, I let it get warm on low (so heat distributes evenly) till I see a little bit of smoke starting to rise- seems to help in avoiding the food from sticking.  I had always used \"non-stick\" pans and have gotten tired of the non-stick going away after a few uses.  I did get a little sticking of the eggs on the grooves of the pan, but I chalk that up to me not getting the utinsil in there to move it around.  As the 952nd person to review this, I would say that this is a quality product worth purchasing.Recipe:1/2 lb bacon cut up1/2 lb hot links cut up1/4 lb turkey or ham deli meat cut up1/4 onion cut up16 large eggsSecret ingredient: Tapatio hot sauceKraft Mexican style cheeseHeat skillet on just above med heat.  When all the meat is fully cooked to your preference (everyone likes their bacon at a different crunch level), add the eggs to the skillet.  I have a small gas grill, and this little frying pan has become my favorite and most useful grilling accessory.  Make sure the skillet is seasoned inside and out, so if the meat bumps into the skillet it won\\'t stick.  They make all kinds of gadgets to grill veggies and other small stuff on the grill, but a plain old cast iron pan does just fine.  Well, for all of my adult life, I had lived with cheap non-stick pans and when my last set went, my husband went and got me a Rachel Ray set for much more than I had ever spent.  I decided that I wasn\\'t going to keep eating my pots, so wanted something without a non-stick coating, and I\\'m too bad a cook to go for a plain metal pot, because I had visions of all of the scrubbing I would have to do to get off burnt food.  I looked at the cast iron, and decided that the price wasn\\'t bad, and if I hated cooking on it, it is heavy enough to make a good weapon if anyone breaks into my house.  For the record, they state that you should use some oil the first few times you cook so it doesn\\'t stick, and I did find that to be helpful, but even when my eggs stuck a little, it was easy enough to scrape right off.  I must say this cast iron skillet is quickly becoming my favorite to cook in after only one week.  The handle is so short that it is always overheating.I own 2 other Farberware larger pre-seasoned cast iron skillets and they arrived in perfect condition.  They also have longer handles which are more ergonomically designed so they are easier to use and never overheat.I love cast iron since it is so durable but it would have been too expensive to ship the Lodge skillet back for a replacement so I kept it the way it was.  I will have to do the seasoning myself on it.I personally think that Farberware makes a better, more user friendly product and would recommend their cast iron products over Lodge.  Again the item is terrific, no more frying potatoes in the skillet first to season it, it works great but very, very small.  The price I got from Amazon, $29.99 plus free shipping, is by the pound about 4 times higher than the world market price for bulk scrap iron, but on the other hand this merchandise is delivered to one\\'s doorstep in the shape of a useful finished cooking utensil, with an excellent preseasoned treatment.  Throw two pounds of mussels into it, right out of the box, or a big steak, or a pan pizza.  Oh but my cornbread sure taste good when baked in my iron skillet.  I already own a cast iron skillet with ridges and use it often for \"grilling\" steaks and fish when I want grill marks.  This skillet seemed like the best option because it has a large cooking surface, it came preseasoned, and because I think that Lodge Logic is a good brand (I own their hibachi grill which works very well).When I use the skillet nothing sticks to it and cleaning is easy.  I use a silicone pan handle sleeve and the handle seems short and a little tricky to grab inside the sleeve.Overall, I am glad I purchased this pan.  The size is good for bulk cooking such as 4 servings worth of food.  Nothing that two hands can\\'t handle though.Below is contains some of the same info as the 6\" skillet review and basically sings accolades about cast iron and Lodge Logic in general.I love cooking with cast iron because it heats evenly.  After doing extensive research on the best cookware that doesn\\'t leech harmful chemicals, I choose to cook with cast iron.  Lodge Logic hasn\\'t failed me; I own the 6 inch version of this skillet and a dutch oven.  I don\\'t even want to try other cast iron products.Cleaning is a breeze as it is virtually non-stick (without those synthetic chemicals).  I can\\'t speak for its oil-free non-stick quality because I love to use olive oil and butter in my cooking (I\\'m a healthy, organic eater and my research says those items are good for you, especially if you use raw butter).  This a great size pan for me and my family.  All the cast iron I own is Lodge Logic and it holds up forever.  Between a cast iron dutch oven (also from my mother\\'s kitchen) and this skillet, for every day cooking, I have almost all I need (my other \\'necessary\\' is a good coffee maker, but that\\'s another story.)  I\\'m not sure how long the well-seasoned skillet was in use before it came to my mother.  I\\'ve had it for a while now, and it\\'s just starting to acquire that wonderful, smooth black surface that all cast iron gets, if used and cared for correctly.  I have an aunt who will not cook in anything but good stainless steel and who looks down her nose at anything cast iron.  Different schools of cooking have different tastes and that\\'s fine.If you\\'ve ever really used good cast iron cookware, however, you will appreciate this skillet.  Throw out all pre-conceived notions of how cooking &#34;should&#34; be done, and you might come to believe that almost everything, from soup to desserts, tastes better when cooked in cast iron.  I would recommend a good skillet for any newcomer to start with, though maybe not this large.For those who are newcomers, let me say this: Good seasoning is an absolute requirement for ALL cast iron cookware.  I would recommend seasoning the pot or pan or skillet at least twice - three times is better - before you use it.  To loosen stuck particles, heat the pan, dump in hot water, and let it boil for a few minutes.  Wipe dry completely, and oil liberally while the pan still retains some heat.  If rust spots should ever develop (which should not happen if the pan is cared for correctly), scour the spots with steel wool until completely gone and then re-season the pan as if it was brand new.  Most people, I suppose, simply don\\'t want to bother with the care needed for cast iron to become an actual heirloom.  This is a really fun little pan to use.  I used it right out of the box to fry an egg and didn\\'t have any problems with the egg sticking to the pan.My only gripe is that they don\\'t make a tiny little lid for this pan!  It makes the best baked chicken then fries eggs in the morning that do not stick.  We love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff - we love nothing more than our cast iron and Lodge makes great ones at decent prices.  It\\'s so healthy too!Just make sure you season it a couple times before first use for nonstick to work better.I love them so much that started my cast iron collection and got rid of all my teflon pots and pan.I highly recommend buying this and other cast iron products, especially made by Lodge- Made in the USA!  We had one at a restaurant and they used a small cast iron skillet.  Despite these traits, it\\'s still not as good as an antique Griswold skillet from the 1940s, because the antique skillet has a much smoother metal finish on the cooking surface, making it much more nonstick.  This Lodge skillet is a bit rough on the cooking surface, as if there was no machining after the skillet was cast.  I cooked two bone-in rib eye steaks with this skillet and it tasted way better than when I ate at a fine dining steak houses.  My only complain is that it is too darn heavy but I guess cast iron skillets are all heavy..  This little pan is so cute and it\\'s uses are limited.  I highly recommend this &#34;Pre-Seasoned&#34; skillet.  I use this size to cook chicken and beef for myself, one serving.  One heavy (yeah, yeah, its cast iron -of course its hefty in weight!)  This cast iron skillet is really nice if you take care of it.  If you are not careful it can turn on you.I would recommend taking off the pre-seasoning and re-seasoning the skillet yourself.  You will get a much better season.Wash with hot water and a scrubber or with hot oil and salt.  If you are not careful your non-stick seasoning can get removed and you will end up with a ruined meal.I have had a good number of times where I did a poor job cleaning it the time before and then my eggs will stick the next time.  It makes me a bit hesitant with really sticky foods, like eggs.Get into a good habit of taking care of your skillet and it will serve you well.  This is in no small part to the quality and duarbility of Lodge items such as this 12&#34; skillet.  After a couple uses, the pan was non-stick enough to make pancakes without butter in the pan.  bacon and eggs cleaned up well, but the chicken got kind of cripsed on, so I had to use a scrub pad, which removed some of the season...be careful!  Growing up in the south I learned quick that cornbread that is actually worth eating must be made with a few simple ingredients:  cornmeal, buttermilk, fatback grease, and most importantly, cast iron.  I\\'d like to think that southerners make the best cast iron, afterall you can\\'t make good cornbread without it.  Never been disappointed with Lodge products.I have others and love them in my Kitchen Sausages are a favorite in our household and I specifically bought this skillet to cook them.  For eggs or larger cut of meat, I recommend the de Buyer pan.  Otherwise, this pan works great for smaller portions.  This review is for the tiny 3.5 inch iron skillet.  I am rating it 5 stars because it is exactly what I expected, a miniature iron skillet to hang on the wall near my stove.  It is an authentic Lodge iron skillet, just very tiny.  I seasoned it again in the oven so that it would be blacker, like the larger iron cookware that I use.  Cracker Barrel also has tiny 3.5-inch Lodge iron skillets, but they have cutesy sayings molded into them, and I didn\\'t want that.  The one sold on amazon is just as shown, a plain little miniature.To use for cooking, the minimum size that is practical for me is the 6-inch round skillet, and that\\'s a very small skillet.  I use my 8-inch and 10-inch iron skillets most often.  I bought a few different sizes all at once I do think this one seems the nicest not only in terms of weight and usability but I also feel the pre-season was the best.  I love cooking with this skillet, it gives everything that a cast iron product should and you can fit almost any size protein in it.  It is even heating, wipes clean easily, BUT it is so heavy that it takes more than 2-hands to pour anything out.  I am thinking of buying the next size down for everyday cooking; it is otherwise over-the-top excellent.  I had this skillet for a couple months now and I have to say that cast iron is the way to go especially when it comes to cooking chicken, beef, pork, etc.  I still have stainless steel and hard anodized cookware but this cast iron skillet is my favorite because it sears to perfection where the steel and hard anodized cookware can\\'t.  I clean it with only hot water and scrap it with bristle brush after the skillet is cooled.  At first, my eggs stuck a little bit but now, I have seasoned it real nicely to the point where they come out amazing.  This is a high quality skillet but can break like any cast iron skillet if it dropped during shipment.  They are all heavy, of course So far, I love the skillet.  Great Gift for those starting off using cast iron to cook with, this has got to be the 5th set of these I have bought for 5 different people, Lodge is a great product, it is pre-seasoned so you can use it right out of the box AND they are made in the USA.  you really can\\'t go wrong with any Lodge cast iron products.  The cast iron heats up remarkably fast, and maintains the heat so much better than my Circulon anodized skillets ever did.  Bacon crisps up wonderfully, steaks sear beautifully, everything is just better with cast iron.  The pre-seasoning on these skillets is great, and will only get better with age.  Just remember cast iron is heavy, and you will need to be extra careful if you have a glass cooktop to prevent scratching.  After I purchased this pan I stuck a dollop of Crisco in the pan and baked it in the pan to season it and now everytime I cook with it, I am more and more pleased at how food turns out.  Loves to cook in it, easy to use..  So far things are going well but I did discover that the induction temp needs to be a bit lower than normal for the cast iron or things burn too quickly.  The seasoning on the pan was ok but I had to reseason again as recommended by Lodge.  So far it worked out well and with the addition of some olive oil things aren\\'t sticking!  Sometimes I like to roast dry spices, mustard seeds or peanuts, and this is just the right size pan for it.  Madhur Jaffrey recommends a cast iron skillet for spices, and this one is good for her recipes.My five year old also likes to borrow it to \"cook\" for her stuffed animals.It\\'s pretty too, in a rough hewn, primitive way.  This is a great, basic cast iron skillet.  :)  It came nicely pre-seasoned, I use it all the time and it looks brand new after a nice, quick wipe down, rinse, and dry.  Cast iron is much better than stainless for fried eggs, and this spacious 15\" pan would provide considerably more room for frying and could saute more without getting so crowded that the food gets steamed.I want it to work out, but I might have to downsize to the 13 inch skillet because I don\\'t see a practical way to heat a pan this large evenly.  This is the perfect size for frying a couple of eggs or melting butter, or heating a bit of sauce.  You will find a million uses for this sturdy little skillet.  Just like the larger skillet, I\\'m so happy to purchase something made in the USA.  I also love the coating that has been applied, must be what they call pre-seasoned I always season my Lodge after I receive my piece.  Always pleased, and in Love with Lodge Cast Iron products.  I have been wanting a cast iron skillet for so long but they were out of reason money wise.  Able to get this one at a wonderful price and it was pre seasoned I love this little skillet.  It tastes so much better from a cast-iron skillet.  This really cooks things up good and really cleans up nice once you have used it several times.  But don\\'t expect it to be just like a non-stick skillet or you\\'ll be disappointed - it does take some care and some breaking-in.Even though it\\'s pre-seasoned, I seasoned it further by heating oil in it to smoking a couple of times, and I still use a tiny bit of oil when I cook in it.  And unlike non-stick pans, it\\'s iron and will rust, so after washing (water only, no soap) I dry it well and wipe it with a little Crisco.  Every once in a while something sticks but a quick scrub with a scrubber sponge takes care of it.The surface is a little more pebbly than my 40-yr old, 12\" cast-iron skillet (which has a mirror-like finish and nothing ever sticks to it) so eggs were a bit of a challenge at first, but after using it for 6 months they rarely stick; over time as I cook with it, it gets better and better.  this one, too, will develop a mirror-like finish and absolute non-stick surface.The best part is, it\\'s safe, no chemical coatings.  The additional handle is nice - helps avoid feeling like you need to hustle from point A to B, before anything bad happens :-)  Plus, it\\'s made in the USA!  ), I would have bought mostly cast iron instead of all the other cookware.  These cast iron skillets turn out a great grilled cheese sandwich, too!  Just use a lid on the pan & be sure to cook only on medium-low heat.Several years ago my mom gave me a wonderful recipe (see below) to make cornbread on the stovetop in the 8\" skillet using a lid, flipping the cake over once the batter looks almost done to cook the other side.  salt in place of self-rising - I\\'m sort of guessing at these amounts as a replacement for self-rising.If you\\'d like to read my method of seasoning cast iron, go to the Lodge Biscuit pan and read my review there.Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Drop Biscuit PanMy DH laughs at me because of my admiration of raw cast iron, enameled cast iron and how I care for them.  **SAFETY TIP**  since these pans get very hot and stay hot, keep children away and make sure you use a pot holder or something to grab.  Cast iron do not cool off like a regular pan.The Lodge iron skillets are excellent.  Keep in mind they are iron and a very heavy metal.So why would you want these heavy pans?  I have a great set of stainless steal pans and they never get this hot or retain their heat.  I also have a very nice set of non stick, they are nice and great for certain cooking.These pans though are ideal for meats, searing, sausage, hamburger, all sorts of dishes that require high consistent heat.  They are simple and durable...just a piece of metal that gets very hot and does what you need in the kitchen.This again is one of the many reason people love cooking with these pans..\\nAny serious cook should have a set or a couple to use for those special homemade recipes mom or grandma used to make.  This eight inch little guy is a great addition to my cast iron arsenal - great for eggs or saut&eacute;ing shallots for gravy.  This pan is heavy, but that\\'s what makes it work so well.  I made a pan-seared steak this evening, which can be challenging to cook properly, but through consistent heating and predictability, it was easy in this skillet.  Great for making steaks at home or even a good burger indoors instead of grilling outside.  Very good value for the money.Dont waste money on the more expensive skillets as this is more than enough to make quality food at home.  Love the extra handle for easier lifting of the skillet.  This size about completes my set of cast-iron skillets and pans.  Love cast-iron; long lasting and easy to take care of.  Non-stick is pretty good and has gotten better every time I use it.  Cast iron skillet every kitchen needs one and this is a good one, just take care of it right and it will last forever.  Did cornbread, turned the skillet upside down and the cornbread dropped right out by its ownself (as it\\'s said in these here parts :-) This is a great skillet, but is very very larger....I don\\'t think a normal stove burner can handle this big boy!  Every serious cook needs a 12\\' cast iron skillet.  Properly seasoned, it is totally non-stick, cleaning up with a casual flick of a paper towel.  I have been known to over use the \"high heat\" setting, and happens that from time to time, billows of smoke emerge from my kitchen.  If that\\'s from a cast iron pan, it\\'s merely a ruined meal.  It works equally well on gas, charcoal, wood fires and electric stoves, so it\\'s a camping essential.It\\'s rim is high enough to use as a saucepan - and that\\'s where the term \"pan gravy\" comes from.  Controllable, even heat is the secret to good gravy - and of course, meat juices.It\\'s equally at home in the oven as on the stove - unlike many composite-handled stainless steel skillets.  The crust of a pie baked in cast iron is equal to or superior to Pyrex.A twelve-inch steak and whatever pie, four inches deep will feed six to eight people easily.It will also fry six eggs at a time; doing duty as a griddle.All told, this skillet is one of the most generally useful items in the kitchen.  I bought this pan in a store for twice what it cost on Amazon, but it\\'s such a great product I have no regrets.This is superb for searing meat and stir fries and so on, and the non-stick capacity improves with each use (with none of the adverse health issues assoicated with modern non-stick surfaces that are so easy to damage).Cleanup on this product is a breeze.  After use just wash with a brush, don\\'t use soap, dry, and either heat it on the burner to get rid of any remaining water on the surface (which is what I do) or spray it with a cooking spray such as Pam (or lightly rub it with cooking oil and a paper towel [I don\\'t do it this way because it seems unnecesary, but it\\'s what\\'s recommended, perhaps in more humid climates like at the ocean than the one I live in]).It\\'s very nice that you can buy a Cook\\'s Illustrated top performer at such a very reasonable price.  Cooks three eggs every morning so perfectly your household will queue up to use it.  Well, I started to panic that the inner dimension is only 10 inches and not the 12 I felt I was replacing.Great news:  when I just ten minutes ago received the pan I put it on my stove and laid my Farberware \"12\" inch skillet inside.  I NOW have 12 inch skillet with a slightly larger than 10 inch cooking surface which is about an inch bigger than what I thought I had in the Farberware piece.I am soooo glad I didn\\'t order the 15 inch Lodge skillet or I would actually have a pan that I could not fit on my glass cooktop and would not have been able to use, not to mention the extra four pounds for the bigger pan and an additional $15 pricetag.LESSON:  Measure your pan.  You might not be so lucky if you don\\'t measure first.The 12 inch Lodge pan has a 10 inch cooking surface.  It is 12 inches on the outside from lip to lip.Please be careful because with cast iron you do need EXACTLY the right size for your glass stovetop as you can\\'t have an overhang of more than one inch or the stovetop can break as per manufacturers instructions.UPDATE:  I have had this pan for a little over 4 years now.  About a year ago I was getting frustrated because all the non-stick abilities were gone and I was getting little black pieces of \"seasoning\" in all my foods.  I quickly realized that by washing it with a scrub sponge and soap was erradicating my pan of its seasoning.  I gave it a quick and thorough cleaning to get all the loose seasoning off and I have since been using only a soft sponge with little soap, and after that, heating up the pan for a minute (at most) with a little olive oil coating the pan.  I once again have a beautiful non-stick pan that I love so much.  For anything that needs to be steamed, I simply add liquid, put the cast iron lid that I bought separately on top and veggies steam right in the pan.I really can\\'t say enough good things about cast iron cookware.  I saw this pan at the outlet store in Wrenthem MA for $80 and thought that was a good deal....i got this as a gold box discount for under $40.  The pan is outstanding and cooks like a cast-iron skillet should...highly recommend this over paying a lot of money for a name brand skillet.  I love to cook steak in a cast iron skillet.  If you\\'re only looking for one cast iron pan, a 10\" is the way to go.As far as quality goes, there is no question.  While I spent endless hours researching the relative merits of hard-anodized and stainless steel-clad cookware, I decided to pick this skillet up in the meantime because it looked A) inexpensive, B) easy to use, and C) pretty darn near indestructible.Three months later, we rarely use anything else!It works equally well for melting cheese on nachos or baking bread in the oven as it does for stir-frying vegetables and cooking omelets on the range.  The pre-seasoning process really works, and if the skillet is cared for properly (gentle handwashing, avoiding too high heat, always stored dry), the nonstick properties of the cooking surface only improve with time.  Do note that cast iron probably isn\\'t for you if you just want to throw it in the sink overnight after use - it\\'ll be a rusty mess the next day, and while this is fairly easy to correct with steel wool and a little effort, cast iron really shouldn\\'t be treated this way.Cast iron is safe for use on a glass-top range; some range manufacturers recommend against it, but if you\\'re careful not to drop or drag the skillet on the surface, it won\\'t cause any damage (see comments).  If you\\'re still concerned about scratching, check out enameled cast iron:Lodge Enameled Cast-Iron 11-Inch Skillet, Cafe Brown THIS SKILLET CAME PRE-SEASONED AND READY TO GO WITH WONDERFUL INSTRUCTIONS.  I would recommend this pre seasoned skillet to anyone looking for a really nice fry pan.  This skillet is an amazing value for such a high quality and useful tool.Literally every piece of meat that I cook is now cooked in this pan.  Chicken, steak, burgers, fish (seared tuna is amazing on from this skillet), you name it.Cleaning cast iron after cooking is 5x easier than stainless steel.  When I\\'m done, I just scrape it with a metal pan scraper (also sold on Amazon) to get the big debris off (be careful not to scratch the skillet with the corners of the scraper).  It\\'s so easy!Cleaning it like this leaves enough of the oils behind to keep the skillet seasoned, and makes it so every meal that you cook tastes better than your last.I love my cast iron skillet.  I have wanted a smaller size cast iron frying pan and am so glad I sent for this one.  One of my favorites This was the first Lodge pan I bought and I am now completely sold on cast iron.  In fact, I have replaced all of my non-stick cookware with old-fashioned Lodge products because of their even cooking capabilities, ease of cleaning and the ability to use them outdoors on an open fire or grill...  It was so convenient having it pre-seasoned and with such a great quality for the price, I wouldnt buy from another brand :) Definitely recommend this skillet!  My husband and I got our first cast iron pan about a year ago.  We\\'ve been learning to cook more lately and needed a cast iron skillet for some of our recipes.  We\\'ve used it about five times now, cleaning it right away and we\\'re happy to report that it\\'s in perfect condition.  Now I\\'ve cooked with cast iron a long time, and one thing I have discovered is that it is best to have a pan for cooking strong tasting meats like fish or cajun dishes.  I use this pan for pretty much all other meats, and it works extremely well.The one extremely important property that needs to be added is simply the fact that you will want a metal spatula to go with your cast iron cookware.  Usually, a small scraping action is enough to separate the food from the skillet, but a plastic spatula just won\\'t cut it in that regard.  Also, a plastic spatula will likely melt given how well cast iron retains heat.  I love iron skillets, I\\'ve used them during the college years.  I still use these, makes me feel like a man in the kitchen, ha-ha.MADE IN THE USA I purchased this skillet and absolutely love it.  Pros:Heavy iron that distributes and maintains heat well.Excellent size that will fit up to 4 burgers simultaneously.Excellent price for a made-in-america product.Come preseasoned, but I still applied 6 coats of flax seed oil, baking it in the oven for 30 minutes between applications.Better than every teflon pan I\\'ve ever used.Best cooking utensil I\\'ve ever owned because the browning is incomparable to other pans I\\'ve owned.  This is the only thing to use for making home fries.It can also be used as a dutch oven if you buy the lid.Also great for camping or defending yourself.Cons:Not for weak wrists and may require two hands to move it off the stove.Doesn\\'t work in the microwave.  I had previously purchased a Dutch Oven and I was happy with the results and decided I could no longer do without a cast iron skillet.  I love cooking in it and can do a steak in the oven that is as good as any that comes off the grill.  It\\'s no real problems for me as I actually enjoy seasoning my cast iron myself and it just involved an extra step of stripping off the pre-seasoning which was easily accomplished.  It cooks so evenly and food doesn\\'t burn like in other light-weight frying pans.  If you don\\'t like heavy frying pans, this is not for you.  Nice big 12\" skillet, no flaws in the casting, factory seasoning not that great.  Cooked some bacon first, it did stick a little in a dry skillet but no big deal to get it loose.  Cleaned the skillet with hot water and a stiff brush; no soap although I do use a small amount from time to time.  Threw the frozen burgers 2 at a time on a 500 degree pre heated skillet (infrared thermometer is awesome) with no sticking problems.  Burgers turned out great.I have since added several layers carbon and the seasoning is pretty good to go at this point.  I seasoned by cleaning it with a small amount of dish washing soap and hot water.  After it\\'s bone dry I add as thin a layer of soybean oil as possible over mostly just the cooking surface.  If it looks kind of oily and not too shiny you\\'ve got a properly seasoned piece of cast iron and it\\'s up to it\\'s full \"non stick\" potential.  Good skillet for the price but factory seasoning is not perfect.  price - very gooddelivery - finepre-seasoned - sort ofcontruction - solidly built and the little one (8&#34;) is actually kind of cutenon-stick - not yet, but...\\nworking on by cleaning it after every use, not applying any soap, and not cooking acidics things in it like tomatoes, and coating it with oil before and after each use.has required a note in it to remind other household members not to use it yet.  and means I have to be very, very good about immediate clean up (boil some water in it after cooking eggs to get the white up).  It is just that I know this can/should work so am trying to get some iron and a more traditional (less toxic) non-stick finish.But, don\\'t kid yourself, it takes attention and intention.  Coat with vegetable shortening,place on top of coal or wood burning stove,cook for three to five days.I have a Harman Mark 1 coal stove, this stove will boil water in a tea pot.  The only drawback to cast iron is the weight, but use them for a few months and you won\\'t even notice anymore.Unlike other pans that warp over time, or come warped from the factory, the cast iron always rests flat on the stove burners.  The spout on the lip makes it easy to pour off liquids and grease.I\\'ve never had a problem using soap on my cast iron pans.  If you\\'re new to cast iron, it takes a bit of time getting used to them.  Once you turn off the heat source, the food continues to cook.I love that I can cook directly over the wood campfire with these pans.  Once you start cooking in cast iron you will throw all your other pans away.  I love this iron skillet!!  I have cast iron pans big and smal, deep and shallow, a handy glass covered one, flat and ribbed cookers of various sorts, pancake cookers, pots, water heater, cornbread cookers, bacon flattener.  Was ordering socks, saw this, applied a credit and here it is, ready for a lot of use.I have several Lodge items, all good.  What a gift to have a cast-iron pan that didn\\'t need initial seasoning.  I purchased this little skillet for my husband who likes to make one egg over lightly every so often.  This is a wonderful little pan and it is so easy to use.  It does come pre-seasoned, but I gave it another seasoning after washing (no soap) before first use.  I season it with a light coat of olive oil and let it sit for a bit.  I have been doing this every time I use the skillet (it takes such a little while), and the results are almost completely non-stick.  It is not necessary to use extremely high heat because the cast iron is so efficient in spreading the temperature evenly.  The larger pans are quite heavy, but the extra handle is very useful so that you can carry them more easily.  I needed a new skillet, and this is the perfect size, and came pre-seasoned.  I have many Lodge cast iron pieces, and this is just perfect for handling.  No worries with a cast iron skillet about preheating to a screaming hot temperature, as you would have with a non-stick coated pan.  Pre-seasoned means not having to mess with oiling and hours of baking in the oven to get the nice coating.  Always wash this cast iron with only water and a good scrub brush.  This is a great skillet for on top of the stove or in the oven (or both).  Only down side is that they are heavy; the lip or &#34;hook&#34; opposite the handle makes it easier to lift but you\\'ll need oven mitts.  It is truly pre-seasoned and after a couple of hours in the oven with a coat of oil, I can easily flip eggs without breaking the yolks.  And you probably get some minor iron intake from cooking in them regularly.Follow the manufacturers instructions about not using soap is the most important thing.  I find that if I leave them dirty on the stove for a day or two, the food debris sort of act as moisture on the pan and can create rust.If you ever get a rust spot, scrub it immediately, dry the pan thoroughly (I like to put mine on the stove for 2 minutes on low to warm the pan and evaporate any moisture), and re-oil it lightly with olive oil or coconut oil on a paper towel.  This includes the bottom, which may not make sense to anyone who is grease fire fearful, but we are talking about a light coating to seal out moisture, the pan should look dark on the outside, not shiny or dripping.My best suggestion is to fry bacon!  This skillet takes up little storage space, and is handy for personal size meals.  Some think cast iron cookware is work to keep up and clean.  And yes, I wash my cast iron skillet, dry it and then I put it in a warm oven or heat it on the stove to ensure the moisture is out of the pan, so it doesn\\'t rust.  It comes pre-seasoned which is nice, but I always apply a thin layer of oil on the cooking surface before use as well as after to keep things cooking beautifully.  Being cast iron, a little TLC goes a long way to keep this skillet in great shape to cook all your food to perfection.  The price I paid was an absolute steal, especially since I could easily get rid of most of my other cookware and use just this piece to cook everything in.  Cast iron is great for heating and cooking food of all types.  The first time I cooked eggs they were the best I\\'d EVER had!  It\\'s also important to keep a coat of oil on the pan to help with cooking, nonstick, and anti-rusting.  We use cast-iron cookware in our camping trailer.  I can cook four fried eggs all at the same time and they don\\'t come close to touching each other.  I cook for just me, so obviously this would be too big for everyday use.  These pans are not super-amazing, professional-grade cookware.I hope you didn\\'t expect that, especially considering the price.But they are just fine, and will perform well, given proper care and regular use.We make pizza in it, and the boys love it.Also great for eggs, tortillas, ground beef, and stir-fried veggies.First of all, disregard the \"pre-seasoned\" bit in the product name.This is to keep it from rusting, not for making a great cooking surface.When you get the pan, wash it thoroughly, scrubbing the inside with a rough rag or really fine steel wool (like #0000).Then coat it with lard (rendered from bacon), and bake it upside down (with a baking sheet underneath) at 250F for about three hours.This will give you a good start on building a great cooking surface or \"season\", which is really polymerized lipids.Then just use the pan a lot.  Use a stainless-steel spatula with a smooth edge.Simply wipe out with a paper towel between uses, whenever possible.If it gets really dirty (e.g.  has lots of charred black bits in it), use a washcloth and water to clean it up.Never use soap (some people talk about \"light\" soaps and what not; I say no soap at all).Never leave it wet.  I recommend sticking it back on the stove for a few minutes to dry it.Eventually, you\\'ll fill in all the little nooks/crannies/pits with polymerized lipids and have a fantastic pan.Don\\'t give up; it\\'s worth the effort.  If you are buying cast iron, think about the weight first and how many in your household.  I pretty much stopped using my 3 Calphalon non stick skillets at this point.Here\\'s my take on the ones I own:3qt oven: heavy heavy heavy but the taller wall is good for small batch frying and small stewing jobs10\" skillet: nice surface size; perfect for grilling a big T bone or 2/3 chicken breasts/top sirloins (get a silicone cover for simmering.  The medium size pizza is good for 2 people.9\" grill skillet: strictly for grilling without blackening (the space between the grill is a wonderful heat transferer) therefore not a multifunctional piece8\" skillet: the size is the top not the bottom (the grilling surface); this is the perfect size for a big pancake, a waffle, or a personal size pizza.  I use it a lot!mini skillet: the size of a small pancake, a sunny-side-up, and a personal corn bread.  It is a wonderful solo skillet for cooking, serving, and baking.  This is a nice heavy skillet and it\\'s so nice to be able to use it on so many cooking surfaces.  If you already have used or own cast iron cookware then you need no advise.  So far is pretty easy to wipe clean but remember not to use wire scrubber or soap in this seasoned skillet which makes absolutely perfect eggs, etc......\\nGreat pan which am sure will last me for many years.  I still really only use it for bacon and to fry things like Mozzarella sticks.  I bought 3 different sizes skillets, so far this is the one that I use the most!  I have a Lodge cast iron skillet for a long time and I love it,I it use for baking,frying,sauteing,stir fry,anything.It\\'s so versatile and food always taste better,so I got this as a housewarming gift for my friends for their new house.I ordered this on a Friday and by Tuesday,it is right on my doorstep,right on tiime for their housewarming party this weekend.Fast delivery,can\\'t beat that!  I\\'ve never owned an Iron Skillet before and I\\'m really glad I purchased this one.  It does take a little while to get to the temperature required for cooking but that is a characteristic of all iron skillets so it can\\'t be penalized for that.  You do have to oil the pan before you use it to avoid food sticking to it and I think that is to be expected.  There might be a better way to use it that doesn\\'t require oil, but I\\'m a novice cook at best so I just do what works.  This is my first cast iron skillet so there has been a little bit of a learning curve in the proper way to maintain it.The skillet feels extremely heavy duty.  I would recommend this to anybody looking for a nice cast iron skillet.  This lodge skillet is great as usual and I have never had any issue with any of Lodge\\'s products.  for some reason her eggs taste better when she cooks them in this pan..\\nLove this skillet!  Great skillet to own, cooks everything perfectly, you are sure to be extremely satisfied with it!I would buy again and i would definitely recommend it.  There are not smooth like the old school cast iron skillets but that was to be expected.  I love skillet cooking.  This is my second cast-iron pan, and I\\'m happy with this product.  Then I can put the cast-iron in the oven without dirtying a separate dish.It\\'s heavy, and I suppose that\\'s a disadvantage, but you know what?  I think that will help me keep a good grip, especially if pouring from the pan.This pan might not fit in some tiny ovens.  I used a tape measure when ordering to decide which size to get, and I don\\'t know where I went wrong but this thing is way bigger than I thought it would be, and being cast iron, is soooo heavy!  But stainless steel kind of sucks for frying, if you crank up the heat, it leaves burned food on the bottom of the pan.  This cast iron allows higher heat and non stick.  I bought this size because I didn\\'t have room for a 12 inch pan and I didn\\'t want something crazy heavy.  Since I live in Manhattan and have a galley kitchen I hang my pans on the wall, and you can\\'t do that with cast iron.  Nothing like an Apple Crisp made in a cast iron skillet on a cold day!  We follow the use and cleaning directions and are super happy with the way it cooks anything we cook in it.  I use this skillet every morning for breakfast and for other things also.  It goes great with its lid and the lid fits nicely The person I gave this to has an iron deficency.  Contrary to popular belief you can cook with cast iron on a glass top stove.  The seasoning is good for first time use.  A little sticking but gets better I\\'ve noticed on my other Lodge pans with subsequent uses.  They do it soon after the cast pan is removed from the mold and is still hot.  I think they do this while the pan is still very hot because the iron is more porous at that time and the seasoning takes better.  I scrub my pans with a medium stiffness plastic bristle brush with steaming hot water and this has not harmed the seasoning.  It\\'s as good as teflon without the toxic fumes and about 10% more stick resistant than a gritty cast iron surface upon initial use.  I\\'m thinking about doing this to my Lodge cast iron pans but don\\'t want to risk the season not taking to it as good as the original.  I quickly dry my pan and rub a light coat of canola oil on it.  I own several pieces of Lodge cast iron cooking vessels and have been very happy with them all.  I swear that food cooked on cast iron tastes better than food cooked on Teflon coated aluminum.  This pan is on the small side, like for personal use.  It\\'s a great quality cast iron frying pan and it looks good.  This is still the same great quality that I have had over  the years with other Lodge items.  I\\'d had non stick fry pans up until now, they worked fine, nothing wrong with them.  It\\'s great for conducting high heat and getting that perfect sear- I love it.  I was reviewing my past Amazon purchases and see where I bought this item nearly a decade ago.I\\'ve used this skillet thousands of times in the past 10 years, and it is one of my most valued pieces of cookware.  After so many uses, it has seasoned to perfection and works so great.If you haven\\'t tried cast iron cooking, this would be a great place to start!  I generally don\\'t use cast iron pans because they are heavy and bulky.  However, there are times and certain dishes that you just need a cast iron pan or pot.  I use cast iron when we go camping or when I want to make dishes like baked pancakes, stews, chicken fricasee, beans or corn bread.What recommends this pan is that it is pre-seasoned, nicely balanced, impervious to scratching or marring, won\\'t warp, it heats evenly, stands up well even under the most extreme temperatures and is easy to clean.This pan is reasonably priced, well made, and renders perfect baked apple pancakes and Dutch babies, fried chicken, and amazing cornbread.  The side handle/grip makes it easy to handle with a couple of pot holders.My only advice (and I am not sure this is even necessary) is to periodically reseason/cure the cast iron.  There is no other pan that can take high heat on your gas stove, total abuse from your steel spatula, then go straight into the oven for cornbread, next out to your firepit for a couple hours, and all this only makes it better.  Only cast iron actually benefits from frequent use.  Great size for an individual and cooking that corn bread!  I bought my husband two cast iron skillets for Christmas and they were his favorite gifts.  If you have never used cast iron for cooking before or have bought into the &#34;it\\'s too hard to use/take of&#34; horror stories, I strongly suggest you give this skillet a try.  Yes, the cleaning and care is different from &#34;normal&#34; pans, but it\\'s not hard once you get used to it.  The quality of Lodge has never disappointed and the price is right (though I don\\'t know why the lid to this pan costs more than the pan itself).  Searing steaks, making gravy or cooking eggs is a breeze and the taste of the food is so much better.  I forgot how much better things are when you cook with cast iron.  I remember the hamburgers that my mother made on her cast iron skillet: thick, juicy, and browned with a flavorful top and bottom that even a charcoal grill could not match.  And although the slightly rough pan surface made those first burgers a little difficult to turn, they were nevertheless just as delicious as I remembered them.  And the pan just keeps getting better with each seasoning and with each use, just as any quality skillet should.  Thank you Lodge for creating a wonderful product--and for helping me preserve a fond memory of my Mom.  Just learning how to cook at 30, this thing is incredible!  So much better than stainless steel!I also own the 15&#34; for batch cooking, and it is equally wonderful (although extremely heavy).I can\\'t recommend Lodge cast iron enough.  For those of you who had the misfortune of receiving a brokenpan....it\\'s CAST-IRON...which makes it solid, but a bit brittle, unlike stainless.And for those of you who love to cook, this pan is a dream-come-true.My wife and I are done with \"non-stick\" pans.  Great item to have under your bed too for protection - that 15 inch size makes Repunzel look pretty good swinging it!Anyway, great, great pan, made here in the U.S. A.\\nI am converting all of my stainless steel pots to Cast Iron.  I know the NEW thing is NON STICK but I think cast on is easy, goes in the oven easy enough and just a little heavy ....that\\'s why I got the little skillet.  I would certainly buy from this seller again and would certainly buy cast-iron skillets.....  I love my new cast iron skillet.  I use salt (instead of soap and water) to clean this one.  It took a few tries to season it but I finally have it to the point where I can make most foods and it is just as non-stick as the Calphalon.  The nice thing is that the more you use it, the more seasoned it becomes and the easier it is to cook in.  Every time I clean it (no soap!  ), I dry it and give it a quick once over with olive oil so it\\'s good to go the next time.  Cast iron isn\\'t the easiest to care for, but it sure is durable.  Follow the seasoning and cleaning directions and you\\'ll have a great pan that\\'s virtually stick free for a long long time!  Using this cast-iron skillet has been a real treat.  The price is a steal for a skillet this well made that will last a lifetime.The size of this particular skillet fits perfectly within the heating ring of a typical induction cooktop, for which cast iron is notably suited.  We mostly use it to cook up greasy breakfast foods and steaks.  I love cooking in my iron skillet, it gives a much better flavor to food.  The price was nice, how ever the pre-seasoning lifted in the center of pan first time I used it.  I have and have used many other iron pans, so I do know how to use and care for.  This is my first cast iron pan.  This is my first cast iron pan.  Takes some getting used to just brushing it out with some warm water for cleaning(NO soap, it ruins the seasoning, takes away the non-stick properties of cast and promotes rust).  We live such busy lives that we were hoping that cast-iron simply meant better and more evenly cooked or prepared foods.The unit we got had a very rough surface, with pits and spots standing tall enough from the surface, which meant we probably needed to season the surface multiple times until we got it a nice, smooth surface, according to the other reviews.  Plus, the cleaning: I have guests coming through my place who will be adamant of washing this pan the wrong way.  For now, I recently picked up the 12-inch Lodget cast-iron skillet.  I also love that I can go from range to oven without worrying about the pan.  It\\'s a great skillet, I use it almost daily now.  Cast iron pans are great tools for my kitchen and Lodge makes a great one.  This skillet is the real deal and comes and the most perfect price!!  This is a heavy, thick, HUGE cast iron skillet.  I\\'m looking for a cast iron skillet like my grandma\\'s, which is smooth on the inside and most of the outside too, making it easy to clean.I don\\'t know how this rough pan cooks and cleans up, though.  Use 1/8 cup aka 1 oz scoop in a hot 6.5\" skillet, preheated with cooking spray, and cook until dry.  I\\'ve always heard fantastic things about cast iron pans, but I\\'d never owned one.  It retains heat very well, cooks evenly, and cleanup is not the nightmare people often depict.I\\'ve been extremely happy with Lodge\\'s 12-inch cast iron skillet.  Got this pan to replace a 12\" cast iron pan that went missing (still don\\'t know where it went..lost it somehow during two apartment moves)This 8\" size is perfect for preparing a small to medium 1-2 person meal.  I\\'ve used it to make spanish omelets / frittatas, and it cooks with that \"homey\" feel.Love this pan, and I\\'m sure it will serve me for the rest of our lifetime and perhaps another generation.  (If I don\\'t lose this one too) Can\\'t believe cast iron pans were old school and ugly.Yes stainless is shiny and nice looking, but for great results, steady even heat and versitility,I love this pan.Corn bread in this sucker...BAM!  I purchased a 10.5 inch recently and then just got the 8 inch pre-seasoned cast-iron skillet.  For some reason the cast-iron got hotter and gave me a much better sear....and much better flavor!  I even made gravy in the skillet after and the clean up was about as easy as a teflon pan....no sticking on the cast-iron!I don\\'t think I will need to purchase the &#34;lodge scraper&#34; or even the &#34;Lodge silicon handle&#34;.  And I use kitchen tea towels to grab the hot handles from the stove or oven.  No need to spend more than I have to on extras.Yeah, a non-stick pan/skillet has it\\'s place - it\\'s had a place in my kitchen all my life.  I just wish I had decided many years earlier to also have a nice relatively inexpensive cast iron skillet in my kitchen too.  This \"pre-seasoned\" skillet comes ready to use, although, as the directions state, you\\'ll need to season it from time to time, especially if you want to cook with only a little oil or if food starts to stick.  Because I can\\'t stand the idea of just wiping clean instead of using dishwasher soap, I do wash it, and I still don\\'t need to season it every time.If you are unfamiliar with cast iron, you should know that it is indeed heavy.  The main handle on this skillet is a little short and narrow; fortunately, it comes with a gripping handle on the other side for two-handed lifting.  You also need to dry cast iron immediately to avoid rust.  But you cannot beat cast iron for an even, radiating heat.This particular cast iron pan (12-inch skillet) is deep enough for pan frying, but it works equally well for saut&eacute;eing and even griddle cooking.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann I started craving the taste of child hood cast iron prepared meals.  I do feel like I am pumping iron but I am sure I will get better strength.  This was my first cast iron purchase and after 3 months of use, it is my favorite and most versatile item in the kitchen!  However, I wipe it clean after each use with a paper towel, and only wash with very mild/small amount of soap (no scrubbing!)  Remember, it is cast iron, so you want that little bit of grease to stay on the pan and keep reheating it with each use to create the \"seasoning\" on it.  I love this pan & no worries of chemical coatings leaching into food!  If you follow the instructions, you\\'ll get a pan that\\'s almost non-stick, retains heat like no other type of pan and will probably last longer than you\\'ll live!  I just got this pan a few days ago, after reading the reviews, which are all true,  and I love it!  I too bought nonstick pans because I hated the clean up and didn\\'t like things to stick.  This pan is very easy to clean and food doesn\\'t stick to it at all, as long as you take care of it properly.  I got so tired of buying nonstick pans because even though they have those long warranties, they alway seem to eventually stick, and then be thrown away..  I never thought a pan could make things taste better until I cooked in this and I swear, you can taste the difference- things have a more intense flavor.  There are no cons about this pan that I can honestly think about, other than it is heavier than your average skillet, but not too bad.  I have found that if the pan is heated up enough before putting anything in it, the food won\\'t stick.  I also use soap and hot water with a scrub brush on it, but after I rinse it, I use a paper towel to dry it off, then rub it down with canola oil and bake it on 450 degrees for about 45 minutes.  Size is perfect for one grilled sandwich or a couple eggs and its cute to boot!Oh, this does need further seasoning.  This skillet is the perfect size: big enough to cook two \"kissing\" over-medium eggs at the same time (or a generous omelette), yet small enough to fit on one of the small back burners I seldom use except to boil water.  I like to clean/maintain my cast iron by swiping it out with a paper towel after cooking, while it\\'s still warm, and then just leave it in place on the stove without having to lift it over to the sink--except on those rare occasions that I burn something onto it and need to scrub it off under water.  I\\'ve cooked in cast iron this way for 35 years and haven\\'t gotten sick from it yet!  I only use cast iron but my biggest pan was only  9 in.  I bought this and when it arrived I thought, geez this is HUGE and heavy but it has become my &#34;go to&#34; pan.  Cast iron is the only way to cook.  I have used a Lodge skillet for many years, mostly for smoking fish.  (Sally Schneider, The Art of Low-Calorie Cooking -- a wonderful book, but only low-calorie if one watches one\\'s step!  )The fish can be brined or just basted with some salt (1 t) , soy (2 T), and sugar (1 T) beforehand.Take care not to burn yourself or start a fire in the process.I bought a new skillet because I broke the old one (long story, not a weakness in the manufacture).  I love and use cast iron as much as possible.  Some things just cook better in cast iron.  The right pan for the job is important when learning to cook.  But every cook should have at least 1 of these pans and if you will only have one, the 12&#34; skillet is probably your best all around pan.  I don\\'t use it often but it is great for baking in the oven and cooking on my stove top.  My lovely bride did some reading on preparing steak in a cast iron skillet.  I still like it for the price and the unusual size and recommend it when purchased knowing what you\\'re getting.  The Lodge cast iron skillet is my favorite cooking appliance.  The grill pan makes cooking healthier but I like it the least because cleaning is a pain.  Here\\'s my size guide:15&#34;: Cooking protein for 4-6 people.12&#34;: Cooking protein for 2-3 people.10.25&#34;: Cooking protein for 1-2 people.If you\\'re buying your first skillet, I definitely recommend the 12&#34;.  The other sizes certainly have uses as well, but if know you need a different size from the above, you probably have a good reason :)Always cook with some sort of fat in the pan: oil, butter, lard, etc.  To clean, scrub with kosher salt (it\\'s cheap!  ), preferably while the pan is still warm/hot, and dry immediately.  This giant piece of iron weighs more than you could imagine...It is worth more in scrap metal than what I paid for it.I shouldn\\'t have bought this giant...I\\'d have been better served buying one size less.  Indeed heavy and needs careful handling but overall it\\'s a great product.  A bit more labor intensive than stainless or non-stick.The pan is almost 8 pounds and could be used as a lethal weapon against intruders.  Itappears to be a well built pan without any sharp edges and has a useful second handlewhich will be hot to the touch.In retrospect after having used this pan for over a year I would have to say I\\'d go witha very good stainless steel pan and forgo using the heavy metal skillet unless needed asa backup or for home defense.Happy cooking to all and to all a good night...\\nWhat more can be said about Lodge cast iron?I just made a deep dish skillet pizza.  Food just tastes better.Good size for over a camp fire.Amazon shipping was Superman Fast !!!!!!!!!  Every time I use it I put it on the stove, rub it with oil and let it heat for a little bit and it is one more day to being conditioned like the others.  :-)As MUST HAVE for a cast iron pan...Lodge HHMT Max Temp Handle Mitt, BlackHandle mits!  Definitely need that helping handle on the other side of the pan.  This thing is beefy, and needs oil on first few cooks for sure.  The possibilities are endless with this skillet, use it for a grilled cheese sandwich, it will work for that too!  It is small enough for those little jobs but big enough that it will be a valuable and useful skillet in your kitchen or camp site!!!  I feel if you follow the directions on care, it should last a long time.Handle really gets hot and makes it difficult to transfer it to the sink or move while using it.  After seasoning these myself, they operate far superior than when I first got them...them as in the two pans I purchased...this one and the 10-1/4&#34; skillet.  Though it comes pre-seasoned, I still coat it (the entire pan, inside and out and the handle, too) thinly with regular vegetable oil and bake it in a 450-degree oven for an hour.  I then let the pan cool completely and repeat the process one more time.  It is true that you need good kitchen ventilation to do this though not over-coating with oil cuts down on the greasy smoke considerably.The pan now looks amazingly shiny and nothing sticks to it.  Everything comes out great and above all, no worries about non-stick chemicals, etc.I do repeat the seasoning process every so often purely for asthetic reasons because I like my entire pan to be equally black!  I prefer to cook with an open flame and the Cast Iron pans distribute the heat evenly and help with the cooking.  The heat is distributed so well and things look and taste great after cooking in these pans and pots.  I use oil to keep the pan working well so if you are a non-oil cooker you might not like that aspect.I\\'ve been using Cast Iron to cook with most of my life, born and raised using Cast Iron and I have to say it\\'s really a great way to cook.  With time my pans are nice and dark and develop their own nearly non-stick surface.  The lids are interchangeable between the cook top pans (like this one), the cook tope ovens and the camp pans that have legs for use with Charcoal.  The similar sizing also helps with storing things since you can stack them nicely in your pantry.Things I prefer to cook in Cast Iron are meats and anything oily.  I do NOT like to cook things that need to be boiled such as rice or spaghetti in Cast Iron, use other pots for that.If you can find one of these at a garage sale or thrift shop, grab it up.  Clean it, season it and it\\'ll last you forever too.In order of how often I use my Cast Iron, I\\'ll list types, sizes and most common usesLodge 5-quart Dutch Oven (loop handles or wire bale) same size as 10\" camp oven; used for cooking meats and family sized casserolesLodge 10-inch Skillet; used for frying up breakfast, grilled cheese and much moreLodge 7-quart Dutch Oven; same size as 12\"camp oven; used for larger family mealsLodge 12-inch Skillet; used for frying larger meals and when camping or groups at homeLodge 8-quart Camp Dutch oven (legs); used for outdoor charcoal camp mealsThere are special Cast Iron cookbooks that have unique ways to use these pans and ovens too, give one of those a try and you\\'ll find many new and tasty things you never thought about cooking in a pan before!5 stars, you can\\'t go wrong with a cast iron pan.  Cast iron is excelent for general purpose cooking, and Lodge Logic makes good stuff.  Plus, the fact that it comes seasoned means it\\'s ready to use straight out of the box.Cast iron is naturally non-stick, and so minimizes the additional chemicals that your food comes in contact with.  Plus, the lack of an artificial nonstick coating means you can use a metal spatula or fork to stir and not worry about it reacting with the surface of the pan.It\\'s not perfect for every situation, though.  But It\\'s in a dark corner of the kitchen, and the Lodge Logic is right on the stovetop.The only thing that holds it back from a perfect score is that, in my experience, the pre-seasoning is a bit shoddy.  But, of course, a couple quick coats of crisco, a couple trips through a hot oven, and it was back up to 100%.Every cook should have a good set of cast iron.  She thought it might be too large and was also worried that she didn\\'t have a big enough burner to heat it, so was going to trade it with me for my 12&#34; iron skillet...until her son and husband saw it.They talked her into keeping it.  I assured her that a good iron skillet will heat evenly on any source of heat.  It is far, far inferior to the better cast iron skillets of the 1930\\'s.  This Lodge skillet is just too heavy.  Simply put I would not recommend this skillet for most women its just too heavy, and could be dangerous if dropped.Still having said that this skillet is affordable, and the pre-seasoned coating is a plus.  So dont give up on it if you dont like the results the first time you use it.The bottom line is if you want a one handed skillet dont buy this.  If you dont mind lugging this heavy thing around with two hands it cooks acceptably well.I\\'m not sure what modern cast iron ware there is out there today which doesnt weigh a ton but this isnt it.  As I got more into cooking and amassed a small army of cookbooks, I realized that every single one of my cookbooks assumed that I had a cast iron skillet for at least one recipe.  When Alton Brown used a cast iron skillet to make delicious looking burgers and tenderloin I noticed he used a \"Lodge\" brand skillet - so imagine my surprise (and delight) to find out how incredibly affordable a pre-seasoned skillet was!Yes, the care instructions make it a little more difficult to wash - but it\\'s not tedious and there is a lot of information on the web with tips to make the process easier.  Certain foods (like fried eggs) are much easier when cooked on the skillet than in my Calphalon pans.While I\\'m not ready to ditch all my pots for cast iron, I am very happy that I did decide to add this to my collection.  Steaks, bone-in chicken breasts, peppers- there are so many foods I love preparing in a cast iron skillet.  A 12&#34; pan is large enough to cook two chicken breasts at once, or two small steaks.  The pan is very heavy and does require special cleaning (brush out residue, wipe clean and apply oil) .  These are fantastic, I actually learned about Lodge Cast Iron in Mexico.  I remember that I was impressed and called them Henry Cabot pans so I would remember after the statesman, Lodge.That was 30 plus years ago, I am not sure I remember the gals name  I dated.  When I opened the box , which had big yellow tags HEAVY USE CARE, I pushed away the plastic air filled bags and attached to the handle was  an American Flag Tag , on the other side was a smaller flag WITH BOLD TYPE LETTERS, Made in the USA.  I am planning on getting a smaller pan  soon.Maybe we can do something like in Finland, who has the best schools in the world these days, teachers must have a masters and teaching credentials,many teachers have been in business retired early and teach.  And I am going to make a note on the will to make sure themom who makes  sure my place is clean gets the Lodge Pans.  Holds heat a long time after cooking, gives even temp throughout pan.  I simply place breasts in skillet season then place foil over it and put it in oven @350 45 min take off foil 20 min before done to crisp up skin.  Other skillet I cut potatoes, onion, 1 pepper, little olive oil, season throw in oven for 45- 60 min and the pan browns and cooks a perfect dinner.  Easy to clean I dont use anything else, even serve from skillet.Reheat pizza is the best!!  Shut off heat under pan place pizza slice in skillet and cover and in 10 min you have slighly browned crust and just a perfect reheated slice, well worth the wait taste better then fresh to me.  Frying is the best, burgers in the pan place lid and it will brown as they cook as well.Its all in learning how to heat and use pan since it holds the heat long, but once you master it nothing cooks food and can crisp food like this.  Heat pan up good throw in veggies and cup of water cover the heat will steam them perfect then throw in butter as water evaporates butter covers veggies, makes them perfect.I also read that cooking in cast iron will supply natually iron into your diet, is it true ?  It\\'s certainly no Wagner Ware, but this skillet (using medium-high heat or lower) is a wonderful thing, not to mention priced very competitively.  I didn\\'t mind the pre-seasoned surface on this particular pan.  Breakfast, eggs, baked dinners, just about anything you can throw at it--and it cleans out nicely.Verdict: For the price, I would highly recommend it!  When it comes to frying or searing a heavy cast iron pan is the best for the job at hand.  None of them perform as well as this very inexpensive cast iron pan for stove top frying or searing.  These pans are heavy and the handles get hot.  It cooks on high heat, in both the oven and on the stove top.  Great for baking cornbread or searing steaks on high heat.Cast iron is not nonstick (don\\'t know where that came from).  When cooking, you want to first heat your pan and then add oil or butter after the pan is hot.Never use soap on it; that is one secret to keep it from rusting.  Dry it immediately with paper towels after use; then put it on a burner on low heat and let it sit for about 3-5 minutes, then turn off the heat.  From time to time, season per directions.If you have never seasoned a cast iron pan, rub it lightly with oil, and place it in an oven at about 350F for about one hour.  Well, it does hamburgers to perfection (one at a time - this is not ha huge pan) too.  But I\\'m sure, since this is cast iron it would stand being placed in the hottest oven for some recipes.  You, too, may learn to love cast iron cooking!  Just fill the pan with hot water after it cools a little after you finish cooking.  I purchased two of these skillets to use for breakfast skillets for my wife and I and we love them.They are your standard Lodge Logic skillets but in a smaller size, which is the perfect size for breakfast.We make them, spread the cheese on them and pop them into the toaster oven to melt the cheese.  Then we can serve it directly at the table, one skillet for each of one and the heat from the iron keeps the food hot while you eat.We also have larger skillets that we could use and have people serve themselves from it, but the individual skillets make a much better impression.We\\'ll be buying more so that when we have guests, each person still has one.The only complaint that I have with it, which I have about all Lodge Logic skillets, is that the surface is fairly rough, unlike some older (no longer in production) skillets.  I have given my son all of my older cast iron ware and just bought a 10 inch Lodge pan with helper handle.  Nicely pre-seasoned--sure, it will improve as you use it more, but it\\'s nice to have it start out usable right out of the package.  The delivery guy does give weird looks for the really heavy flat box *chuckle* I\\'m new to cooking and this pan is insane.  I\\'m not new to baking and have made some killer desserts in it, too (like a one-pan skillet cookie).  This skillet came pre-seasoned and with more space than I will probably ever need.  It definitely takes some strength to pickup this skillet and you will want to be sure that you can do that with liquids and foods in it.  I have had the Lodge 12-inch skillet for over a year, and liked it a lot.  It\\'s basically just as &#34;non-stick&#34; and easy to clean as Teflon-coated skillets, but without the risk of the coating scraping off over time and rendering the pan unusable.  Cast iron pans can truly last forever if you care for them properly, and for under $20 this one is absolutely a steal.  This one was reasonably priced and pre-seasoned, so I bought it together with aT-fal E9180764 Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Expert Interior Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator Anti-Warp Base Dishwasher Safe 12-Inch Saute / Fry Pan Cookware, Gray, figuring that one or the other would eventually make a good replacement for my warpedRachael Ray Hard Anodized II Nonstick Dishwasher Safe 12-1/2-Inch Skillet, Orange.  The trade-off is that the pan is extremely heavy, and of course, both the handles get blazing hot, making it doubly unwieldy.  (I boughtLodge ASHH41 Silicone Hot Handle Holder, Redto solve part of the problem.)  Obviously, the thermal properties of the cast iron are this pan\\'s big selling point, but I was not impressed with the \"non-stick\" qualities at all.  After washing, I went to the Lodge website for instructions on re-seasoning the pan, and I thought I had followed them correctly, but when my pan emerged from the oven on the first seasoning attempt, it was sticky with a stubborn, baked in layer of dried oil.  Nothing sticks to it and no seasoning is required.Cast iron makes great heirloom kitchen gear, but as good as this pan is for cooking everything but eggs, it\\'s a real chore to care for and doesn\\'t perform like pans with modern coatings.  If you are a traditionalist with time on your hands, or you want to get a good bicep and forearm workout while cooking, this Lodge frying pan may be just the ticket for you.  (That said, I went to the Lodge website, followed their re-seasoning instructions to the \\'T\\', and my pan is as good as new.  Won\\'t try to cook eggs in it again, but otherwise, I\\'m happy, which is why it still musters four stars.)  (This is an update of my original review, now that I\\'ve been using this frying pan for ten months.  )I\\'ve been using cast iron frying pans all my life and was glad to see this being sold on Amazon at half the price my local hardware store gets for it.  It\\'s the first pre-seasoned cast iron pan I\\'ve owned.  I was skeptical about it and wondered whether I should look for one used or at least not pre-seasoned.However, the pre-seasoning works great, although after a few weeks of ownership I did season it myself, but this was because cooking at too high heat had damaged the pre-seasoning.  Here\\'s how I keep my cast iron pans in good shape:1) If the pan is new and not pre-seasoned, or if it\\'s been abused, I put it in the oven for several hours at around 100F with vegetable shortening covering the bottom of the pan.  If a pan\\'s been really abused, you may need to clean it with oven cleaner, but this is a drastic step that should be avoided if possible.2) Always cook at low heat.3) Before cooking, allow the pan to warm up at very low heat with cooking oil in it.4) Clean it with a dry paper towel.If a dry paper towel doesn\\'t completely clean it, use cold water and a sponge, but this will remove some of the pan\\'s seasoning.  I bought a few diffrent sized Lodge cast iron pans to use on my grill and have loved the results.  I use them right on the grates of my Weber Genesis to cook bacon, pancakes, vegtables, fajita meat, or anything else that would fall through the cracks.  I always make sure to put a light coat of oil on the pan after I use it.  I have also used the pans inside to make a few different things in the oven and have had equally good results.  Was a little concerned about whether the pre-seasoning would really result in a non-stick first use due to some of the reviews on here.  Cleaned it with water and a brush, dried it, placed it on the burner for a couple minutes, paper toweled some oil on its surface and it\\'s beautifully black and ready to use tomorrow.  I am considering buying the next size up for two people.I like cast iron a lot though and this one is great for one person.  well worthy I use this pan almost every day.  I have a small family, but like to cook a double-batch of almost every main course for leftovers, and this pan allows me to saute without boiling everything.  As far as storage goes, I have a warming drawer in the bottom of my range that accomodates this skillet and my two 12\" cast iron skillets just fine.  I rarely use high heat with cast iron.  This skillet ROCKS - and what\\'s better is that it\\'s made in the USA!Easy to clean too.  Great price, it IS basically non stick ( eggs are still a bit of an issue) and although I thought the size might be too big for my two-person household, it really is just perfect.Being cast iron, it IS a bit heavy, but if you don\\'t have any physical limitations, it\\'s perfectly workable.  This skillet is a little smaller than what I wanted, but I didn\\'t realize that until I got it.  It\\'s great quality, reminiscent of the old cast irons my grandmothers had.  Small and relatively light and easy to use and store it is a perfect size for when you dont want to take out a larger skillet.  After waiting a month to get the thing because it was back-ordered, I FINALLY got to try out my skillet.  Most of my cookware is garden-variety non-stick and hardly suited to things like searing steaks or fajita meat.You can run this pan as hot as you dare without hurting it - works great for steaks, and makes an awesome cheese steak.  The pre-seasoned coating works as advertised, and the cast iron gives good heat transfer and VERY even heat across the entire pan.  I think I\\'m going to be using this skillet A LOT.A handy suggestion regarding cleaning that I stumbled across on another website...  Immediately after cooking, fill the pan with HOT water (not cold; you could crack it!  ), put it on high heat, and bring the water to a rolling boil...  Dump the water and immediately wipe dry with a paper towel, set on the (turned-off) burner briefly to dry completely, and wipe the cooking surfaces with oil.Another note - want those steaks well-done but juicy?  Sear both sides of the steak on medium-high (about 3 min each), then flip, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook as desired, flipping the steak once along the way (about 5 minutes per side for a small, well-done filet mignon).  Your cooking times may vary, but the combo of cast-iron skillet for searing and lid to keep things moist while cooking works exquisitely.  Lodge Logic is always top quality and this small size is very handy for a single person, side dishes or small ingredients of recipes.  We have a lot of fish fries and we still prefer to pan fry over deep fry and this skillet is perfect!  I have a number of Lodge logic pieces...grill pans, skillets and a Dutch oven, and I love them all.My family has cooked in cast iron since I was a kid.  I like it as it does cook stuff better than our non-stick frying pans.  Pros:Durable cast ironGreat for pizzas and steaksCons:Takes a while to get seasonedNot the best for some things like eggs even after seasonedCan\\'t leave it soaking lazily in the sinkOther:The 12 inch skillet fine for making pizzas but for everyday use its a bit too large, I also have an 8 inch which is perfect Now, do not buy this if your marriage is rocky because one bang on the head with this skillet will knock you cold.  CAST IRON IS THE ORIGINAL NON STICK SKILLET.  Cast Iron is ALWAYS a superior value for the money, and this pre-seasoned version takes the hassle out of \"getting it ready to use.\"  Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a Lodge Cast Iron Skillet and Dutch Oven!  It is just the right size and of course you can\\'t go wrong with cast iron.  I don\\'t use the rubber handle cover though...it doesn\\'t fit tightly and I don\\'t feel it holds the pan securely, so I just use a pot holder if I need to move it or pick it up.  One great skillet for frying bacon and making corn bread.  I have often heard in the past how people liked their cast-iron cookware.  Thought I\\'d try it with a small purchase, so I ordered this small fry pan.  The very first time before I used it, I added about two tablespoons of lard, set the gas stovetop on low, let it melt, then used a paper towel to wipe it all over the Pre-seasoned pan.  A good size when the kids aren\\'t home and I\\'m only cooking for one.  It has never rusted, has had to get re-seasoned only once due to a slight over drying on the stove top after washing, and nothing sticks in it.  LOL We really like the fact the skillet is pre-seasoned.  The additional small handle makes it easy to go from stove-top to oven.  This was quite a disappointment, especially as I remember my father and grandmother cooking with cast iron skillets.  I loved those pans and everything that came out of them.That red handle is amazing.  Pre-seasoned skillets is the only way to go.  We will be getting a good workout handling this pan.  Pan is great quality.  This little frying pan is exactly what I wanted, you can sear a food and then safely put it into a hot oven.  I think every kitchen should have at least one cast iron skillet.  served to the table boiling hot in the a cast iron skillet.  It\\'s also great for steaks, burgers and hotdogs if you want to prepare them on your stove although Lodge has skillets that are better suited for that.I heard that Lodge is the brand to get.  but looks good and i hope that the food doesn\\'t get stuck like it has happen to others I LOVE Lodge cast iron cookware.  These pans get better and better with use, and you aim for that \"black glass\" finish that another reviewer mentioned.  Until that point, however, be aware that even the pre-seasoned cast iron is not going to give you the nonstick performance of a pan with a true nonstick coating.  I use my cast iron for as much as possible but keep a couple of nonstick skillets for frying hash browns and eggs because, frankly, my cast iron still tries my patience with those items.  That said, cast iron works BEAUTIFULLY for just about everything else.  I still get a small amount of sticking when cooking eggs, but i think that could be a temperature problem.This thing makes an awesome steak.  The silicone handle was a nice addition, but is not useful for lifting, you still need to use an oven mitt because this thing is heavy.  I own several other brands of cast iron and this is the skillet I use the most.  Well Lodge makes just such beast, it\\'s the \"Lodge Combo Cooker\" Same size, only comes with a lid that doubles as a flat griddle.If you need a 10\" skillet get the combo cooker instead you will be much happier.  Lodge is the best and lasts forever if taken care of properly which is a no brainer.Thanks Amazon - Love you too.Grandma Nel This cast iron Lodge pan is fully seasoned, ready to go.  Personally, I found that with just the standard pre-seasoning, chicken breasts and stuff do stick to it.  About 60-30 minutes before I\\'m ready to start cooking I put the skillet on medium heat and pretty much forget about it for 10-20 minutes, season with oil and turn of the stove.  After a few re-seasonings, this skillet is a dream, cannot express how much I love this thing!  Even though it is way bigger than our electric burners, it still works great as the whole pan heats up.  Aluminum and teflon cooking surfaces both have serious health concerns, so I won\\'t cook on anything but stainless steel or cast iron.  I had a large cast iron pan that was not a Lodge, it was awful, it did not heat evenly and did not keep its seasoning.  So far I have not been disappointed, the skillet has performed flawlessly, it heats evenly and keeps its seasoning.  I highly recommend this skillet and other Lodge ironware products.  We are new to the cast iron world after we researched and found out majority of non stick pans are so dangerous and bad for your health.  I\\'m pretty strong but I\\'m thinking I might just skip my weight lifting workout and just cook with my new heavy cast iron :)  (joke).  Needed a good priced pre seasoned old fashioned cast iron fry pan, this one fit all my parameters.  Little extra handle opposite the main handle is good for weak wrists like mine with a hot mitt or  Ove Glove Very nice cast iron skillet, I\\'ve never been disappointed in any of Lodge\\'s cast iron pots and pans, just my opinion but I think they\\'re the best!  Reading the reviews of Lodge skillets, I get the feeling that the cast iron skillets have a considerable cult aspect.  I have an ancient 12\" iron skillet that works very well for browning meats and for good heat distribution.  One caveat: do not start with frozen foods, I did and the frozen glazed-seasoned vegetable meal stuck like crazy glue.  I really enjoyed this skillet for cooking small meals, but was very disappointed when the handle fell off soon after I received the skillet.  I use this for a small chicken fryer 2 or three pieces with lid (Lodge Logic L5IC3 Cast Iron Lid, 8-inch  ) and any time cook on the stove using an 8\" skilletthis will last a 100 years If it dose not grow legs and walk awayI rub all my cast-iron with vegetable oil after each use the perfect nonstick surface gets better with use and can be renewed if needed This is the pan I started with to go back to cast iron after years of trying all kinds of teflon coated and plain steel types.  This pan came to me perfectly seasoned and ready go.  When seasoned correctly they work as well as regular nonstick, except they cook much better!Get this pan piping hot, add a tiny drizzle of oil to the meat after seasoning then toss into the pan and you will get the most perfect crust.  If you have some hard to clean messes all it takes is a tiny bit of water and let it simmer for a minute and it will release the food, then just rinse, dry, and add a bit of oil or grease.After using these for so long I just can\\'t see myself using anything else to cook on.  This pan is the perfect size for 2 people.  They\\'ll outlast you, your grandchildren will be able to use them and then theirs too probably.I have used other cast-iron skillets and pans.  I believe the quality of LODGE is much better and when pre-seasoned, which this comes as, it starts accumulating flavors from all the food you cook in it.Never wash LODGE with soap and water.  If you use water then please completely dry and if you store it with a lid put a spacer between the lid and the skillet.  You don\\'t want rust on any cast-iron.LODGE makes wonderful scrappers for cleaning and there are silicone handles to remove hot pans from the oven or around on the stove.  The skillet is bigger than I wanted but it is a great product and will last forever.  It is hard to beat cast iron cooking about anything.  Don\\'t know if they make it in the US or Bangladesh, but it does a great job on my blackened fish.Will one day use it as a present for one of my ignorant, undeserving, pseudo-chef of a friend.  The only new cookware entering my house will be Lodge cast iron (and not some cheap knockoff).  It\\'s just the best for cooking, easy to clean, and the handles never break.  This is the 4th Lodge Logic brand cast iron pan I have bought and I love them all.  This one is perfect for sauteing small items or for cooking 1 egg.  The old fashioned iron skillet.Keep it clean, but not scrubbed with harsh pads, or other.  Before I use it each time, I rub a tiny bit of Coconut Oil all over the inside of the pan to just \\'season it\\' a little bit.  Worth the investment easy to pick up with 2 hands Ya\\'ll out there looking for the best price on cast iron cookware should  look no further.  Even though I grew up in the late forties and fifties with my mother frying everything in her twelve inch cast iron skillet, I was a bit squeamish about having one myself.  I know I\\'ve got to give this pan a chance and only have used a couple times because my eggs stuck horribly both times.  I\\'m hoping with time this will be as effective as my non-stick pan.  I grew up with cast-iron (pre-Teflon days)and know the benefits.  I still use the non-sticks for casual and fast cookings but use cast-iron the majority of the time.  I love to cook and like to feel connected to my cookware (weird, huh?)  Once they are seasoned properly (properly is key), they are very hard to beat for anything other than recipes that call for non-reactive cookware.  Yes, any cast-iron does need to be seasoned but it takes much more than one introduction of \"oil to heat\" to achieve that seasoning.  One has to cook several, if not many times in cast-iron for it to become indispensable.  It prevents rust and makes the pot or pan easier and easier to clean the more it\\'s used.  this is a pretty heavy iron skillet and i love it, it distributes heat very well and keeps heat for good period.  Heats evenly and well, and is the perfect size for toasting spices and seeds- I use this on cumin a lot, prior to grinding it for my cooking.  Great little skillet, highly recommended.  I had never used cast iron before, but I heard it was great for anemics and people that want to avoid the chemicals in nonstick pans.  Every time I re-season it looks as good as new.When I first received it, I washed the pre-seasoning off and re-seasoned it with with grapeseed oil.  The soap had removed the seasoning, but the pan was fine and was easy to season again.It is a healthy choice and helps support American jobs.  It is a very heavy pan so if you are older it may not be a good choice unless you have help in the kitchen.  This pan is a little heavy and it supposedly weighs 5 lbs...but with food added makes it seem like 10 lbs.  It seemed to be already seasoned well..but i just added a bit of corn oil before cooking anything 1st time and wiped it over inside and stuck in oven ..and in 1 hour of sitting in oven at 400 degrees..it seems to not have ANY issues with sticking afterwardsThe food is great after cooking inside it and it is so easy to cook with.  Just add the ingrediants and put a lid over it and set in oven and come back 1 hour later and it tastes as nice as a dinner at a high priced restaurant.Btw would recommend getting the lid that goes with this by Lodge too...but problem is it weighs as much as the pan..so look at another 5 lbs added to already 8-10 lbs of pan and food to lift out of oven.  Might use it for other things as well, but for now, it is perfect for my needs.  I did do additional seasoning when it arrived by lightly coating with oil and baking in our toaster oven at 400+ degrees (out of doors to let it smoke real good!)  Did this 4 times and it really added a nice slick coat to it.  First we thought we got a big pan but this turned out very good size to do anything.  I recommand smaller size for everyday use.But I like this pan.  I\\'m no stranger to a grill either.I have this skillet, and the 15&#34; cast iron skillet when I cook for larger groups.  We were using the non-stick store bought set which of course we all know we have to be careful with what we use in them as they scratch easily.  The reviews that say otherwise seem to be mostly from people who are not familiar with how to properly care for cast iron.  My mother and grandmother (and various aunts) used cast iron, and I\\'d never tried using it because I didn\\'t want the upkeep that goes with them (you can\\'t leave wet to dry, have to season each time, don\\'t use soapy water, can\\'t stack with other items, etc).  However, after having numerous frustrating experiences with other pots, pans, and skillets, I decided to fork over the money to get the cast iron that I knew would work, but is more work to use.  Even things like eggs, which are notorious for sticking, are easily cooked and the slight sticking of any residue is very easy to just peel up with the spatula.  If you do wash wet, you just use hot water and a brush, if necessary, and dry thoroughly (immediately, so it doesn\\'t rust).  The great thing about seasoning is that it is automatically ready to cook with the next time you need it for things like stir-frying, saut&eacute; type stuff, etc.  The more you use it, the more well seasoned it gets, and the better the surface for non-stick appeal.  You can use them on a variety of surfaces, and they\\'ve done really well for us during things like camping, over fires...\\nMy son is two now, and my pans are a natural non stick that are way better in heat distribution and non sticking.  We have many pieces of expensive cookware but nothing works as well as this American classic.Searing a steak or saut&eacute;ing eggs are examples of everyday use.  It is also the only pan we can put in the oven or use on our barbecue grill.  After roast is done, I just put it on a platter to rest, place still hot pan on stove top turned on high, & make the best gravy!  Cast iron is the only way to cook and I do a lot of cooking.  Every body knows that a good cast iron skillet is an essential tool for frying chicken.  2008 I purchased a Lodge 12&#34; cast iron skillet for $25.00 on Amazon and used it as my main piece of cookware.  I use it for almost everything, last year I started to use it to make Pan Pizza, the top of the 12&#34; skillet is 12&#34; but the bottom is 10&#34; , a 10&#34;: Pan Pizza is enough for me but if I have company I would have to make two pizzas, so I purchased the Lodge 15&#34; cast iron skillet and the diameter of the bottom of the 15&#34; skillet is 12&#34; it is only two inches more but it seems like it is a lot bigger and more filling ( I posted a photo)I enjoy reading the customer reviews of the Lodge products and somtimes find useful tips for cooking with mine.  I have really enjoyed cooking in both of these skillets.  But the clean up has not been a problem and the cooking has been great....  I just make sure I clean it after cooking (I don\\'t let it set) and only with water and a brush and season after every use.  I got the tiny one and is perfect for cooking single meals for myself or when I\\'m using my larger ribbed cast iron skillet to make smaller things like garlic toast or a couple of brats.  My larger skillet is just that, larger and takes up an entire square on the stove so, with this being so much smaller it works perfect for cooking duel burners.I don\\'t think I could be any happier with this skillet!  So happy with my first cast iron skillet purchase!  Pros:1- Pre seasoned, but I added another seasoning layer myself.2- Even heating- it comes to temperature and stays there.3- Easy clean up with a little boiling water, a brush, and if its really dirty I brush in a bit of salt.Con:It is heavy.I heartliy suggest that everyone get one of these pans.After trying it out, I bought a 5qt.  The quality is excellent, clean up is a breeze and food cooks so nicely.  We purchased one of those \"chainmail\" deals to clean these pans and those work like a charm.  We\\'re so pleased with the Lodge cast iron pans and are so glad we converted from \"non-stick\" to cast iron.  Good ole Made-in-the-USA cast iron...of course it\\'s awesome.  Lodge has been making this stuff for a long time and they know what they are doing.  It arrived ready to go...pre-seasoned and included the silicone hot handle grip.  I live alone and usually cook for one, and this skillet is the perfect size for me.  I debated between this and theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 6-1/2-Inch Skillet, and I\\'m glad I chose the 8 inch pan.  So this small skillet lets me fry up 2-3 slices of tofu without wasting too much oil - perfect!I\\'m a recent convert to cast iron, and I\\'m cooking more than ever just to have an excuse to use the skillets (in addition to this one, I also own theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle, which is perfect for tortillas and pancakes, and theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker, which is perfect for...well, everything else).  And once it\\'s smoked, it leaves a sticky residue in the pans, no matter how hard I scrub with a brush under super hot water.  I\\'ve been happily using safflower oil, which is a neutral flavored, high heat oil that cleans up easily without soap.Bottom line: I love this pan, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who\\'s willing to use and care for it properly.  Missed the cast iron pots and pans my Mom and Grandma had...still think there is really nothing better, you can keep all the new fangled cooking utensils...the \"old\" work beautifully...  The Lodge Logic line is great, easy maintenance, great cooking results.  The silicone handle fits perfectly and the size of this pan is awesome!  The seasoning they have on the pan will keep it from rusting and is good for greasy foods, but its not good to start with something like, say, eggs.  I suggest starting off with something like bacon or sauteing onions, and then seasoning the inside of the pan only a couple of times before you attempt that fritatta or omelet you were super excited about.  Works excellent, is non stick once fully seasoned, and USA made.Not much more to say, other than we really like the silicone handle, it stays cool enough to use without a mitt, yet removes easily if we ever want it off, and slips back on quickly and easily.  It makes a good griddle, is non-stick and holds a lot of food.  Overall it is a must-have pan and the one I always reach for first.Kitchen Collection (website and store often found in outlet malls) makes a lid called the \"Extra Large Multi Cover\" that fits this pan perfectly and makes the pan even more versatile.The skillet is rather heavy, but with the helper handle, it has not been a problem moving the thing around even when full of food.  The pre-seasoning is a start, but I just lightly washed it and then reseasoned it first thing.  It has been entirely non-stick for everything from eggs, to green beans to meats since.The pan\\'s actual measurements are 15\" across the top and 12\" across the interior bottom.  i love it that you can use these on the stove, and then stick em\\' in the oven to finish off the cooking of whatever you may need to braise or sear first.  Because I have a moderate case of arthritis in my hands, I was a little concerned that the 12\" skillet might be too heavy to lift, but -- thanks to the second handle -- it\\'s manageable.  Here is the deal...it can be used on the stove, in the oven, over the campfire to make the best meals you ever had...fries up bacon perfect then oh, the eggs...pancakes golden brown...create tons of corn bread mixes.  As I\\'m getting older, I needed a pan a little smaller, but large enough to cook 4 hamburgers at a time.  I love the size, and Lodge products are always fantastic.  If you have a normal sized stove, you should expect to lose the usage of one of your adjacent burners/elements.It\\'s so damn big that I\\'m not sure I\\'ll use it that often.  This skillet is easy to use, cooks food very evenly, and cleans up easily using just hot water and a scrub brush.  As long as you dry it after use on the stove (at low to med temp), then add a few drops of oil and spread it around with a paper towel while the skillet is still hot, and let it cool that way, you\\'re good to go.  Excellent quality, and the extra handle helps because skillets are heavy.  i do clean it with water immediately after use, and then heat it to dry and apply oil.  i\\'m sure i\\'ll get to the point where i\\'ve built up the seasoning layer and achieve a \\'non-stick\\' surface, but i\\'m not there yet.  I have gotten two of these...one I primarily use to fry eggs, and the other as a saute pan when cooking for myself.  This pan is the best tool for perfect roast chicken, hands-down.  (this depends on the size of the chicken; chicken is done when the thickest part of the bird has reached 165.)  Remove the skillet from the oven, and you will have a golden bird, on a bed of potatoes that have been seasoned in all that lovely roast chicken juice.  I don\\'t like non stick due to the toxic chemicals and you must always replace them, even the high quality ones that are expensive must be replaced no matter how careful you are with them.  I have a 12 inch cast iron skillet that was a bit too big for everyday use, especially when making omelettes for my kids (small sized), so I ordered this skillet.  It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I use it all the time: grilled cheese sandwich, omelette, melt butter, small quesedilla, etc.  Anyway, this size is great if you have small children or cook only for yourself.  Keep it clean and seasoned and you can cook anything in it.  I got this larger size so I could cook everything from pancakes to curry in one pan.  Clean up is easy, simply boil a  cup or two of water in it and then use a stiff brush to scrape off the junk.  What a great skillet for the price My wife and I have been looking for a non-toxic/non-stick method of cooking for a long time.  \"Zero Stickage\" Just ensure you clean and care for the pan as described and it will last a very long time.  Better for the environment - not using dishsoap and I can cook eggs in it without sticking.  I find that it gets a crisp coating on the eggs much better than a regular non-stick skillet.  Only downsides to the cast iron is it takes longer to get up to temperature and longer to cool down and its def heavier than a comparable size modern non-stick skillet.  So far I have been able to clean it with just hot water and a sponge and once dry I give it a very very  thin coating of olive oil and store it.  Of course, when it make sense to do so.So far this is a great skillet for small jobs.  The more you use it, the better it will get.I have to say that I really love this skillet.  It will take a bit to warm up, but it will definitely warm up good.Once it\\'s ready, I coat the bottom and sides of the skillet with butter.  Crack a couple of eggs into the skillet and let them cook until they are ready to flip.  overall a great product, the preseasoned makes this skillet ready to go out of the box, highly recommended, great flavor There are tons of ways people can season cast iron but let me share something I\\'ve yet to find anywhere: use a cotton, BBQ basting mop for seasoning.  Cast iron is porous so it makes more sense to get the pores open so you can clog\\'em with grease.  If you see smoke, take it off the burner.Instead of using X many paper towels & burning your fingers, rub the oil into the pan with the basting mop.  After the pan cooled, I heated it on the stove, added a little butter, & hardly any egg stuck.  !You know the pan\\'s seasoned nicely by the sound your metal spatula makes.  I use my skillet everyday & don\\'t regret the purchase 1 bit.  Good luck.update: If you don\\'t wanna fry bacon, use coconut oil.  Frying an egg is the best test, & I love it when the cheese easily lifts off the pan.  I love cast iron cook ware and this one fits the purpose; however, the weight is not as heavy as the others I own; not so happy about that.  As with all lodge cookware this will last forever and is almost impossible to damage.But Be Warned, This is one HUGE pan.  Out of respect I still use it for certain recipes, but my 10-1/4 inch Lodge skillet is the workhorse in my kitchen.Fortunately for you the \"new\" Lodge does have the helper handle...and you can use it for a life-time and still pass it on your children.I have 30 years experience in the manufacturing industry and have been responsible for the purchase of several thousand tons of metal castings.  I love this pan for meat, It cooks one of the best steaks I have ever had.  Not so great for eggs so far maybe will get better after seasoning for a while.  easy to clean, just add some water while still warm and scrub with brush then wipe out with dry cloth.  As far as cast iron goes, this is about as perfect as can be.  Although I always diligently season my cast iron pans after nearly every use, and could get away with a pan that wasn\\'t pre-seasoned, I still think buying a pre-seasoned pan makes a lot of sense because you can get started cooking right out of the box.  It also gives you a head start on your own regular seasonings--it takes care of those difficult first 3 seasonings for you.On my first use of this pan, I pre-heated the pan for 3-4 minutes, used a little canola spray (not much) and fried an egg.  It\\'s just brilliant, and I use it whenever I cook meat these days--it just always tastes better.  Lodge Logic has a good reputation for their cast iron products.  We have a wood stove and I was looking for cast iron products that we could use if there was a power outage of some kind.  after going through all of the coated pans, teflon, enamel, I have come to realize that the old traditional cast iron pans are the bestthe lodge logic is made here in USA and is absolutely the best buy around Took the plunge and bought this cast iron skillet as I was tired of buying &#34;throw away&#34; nonstick pans.  Cooked eggs this morning and they came out completely stick free!  This is my favorite cast iron skillet.  (...)The great price of this skillet prompted me to give his recommendation a try.  Over time, our skillet has slowly replaced most of our much more expensive pans and I love being able to not worry about scratching or damaging it when using metal utensils.  It\\'s great for any kind of frying, chicken, fish and you can even do a steak though I will say that this is a smokey process indeed.To pan-grill a steak, grease the pan lightly and sear the steak on each side, testing the meat for done-ness by pressing on top.  When finished grilling, remove steaks to a warm plate and you can deglaze the pan with a swish of cognac or wine, add a swirl of butter for a very luxurious sauce.Washing this pan requires hot water..and no soap.  I always season my cast iron - new, or used (hey, I don\\'t know WHAT someone else used that old piece of cast iron for - maybe cleaning auto parts).  These mistakes give the same result - a sticky brown coating that is definitely not non-stick, and the first time they bring any real heat to the pan, clouds of smoke that they neither expected or wanted.  So I scrubbed the pan out with a plastic brush and a little soapy water, rinsed well, put it on a medium burner, and waited.  Cast iron tip number one - give it a little time.  Cast iron conducts heat much more slowly than aluminum, so you have to have a little patience.Then I threw in a pat of butter, and brought out the natural enemy of badly seasoned cast iron - the egg.  Besides, it\\'s kinda fun.Here\\'s cast iron tip number two - season at the highest temp you think you\\'ll ever cook at - or higher.  If you don\\'t, you won\\'t get the full non-stick thing, and the first time you bring it up to that temp you\\'ll get clouds of smoke from the unfinished seasoning.  This is a good thing - that\\'s smoke that won\\'t be jumping out to surprise you the first time you try to cook with any real heat.  Dry, absolutely no stickiness, black as a coal mine at midnight and shiny - but still bumpy - could it possibly work with that rough surface?I put the skillet back on a medium burner, put a pat of butter on and tossed in a couple of eggs.  Just a quick hot water rinse with a brush in case something got left on the pan (I couldn\\'t see anything, but hey), then I put it on a med-hi burner till dry, put a thin coat of lard on the pan and waited until I saw smoke for a minute.  The Lodge pre-season isn\\'t a perfect surface out of the box - but it does give you a big head-start.  After a night\\'s work, my iron is ready to face anything, and you just can\\'t beat that.Lodge makes a great product.

If you really want to see the family\\'s eyes pop, serve up some plate-size pancakes for breakfast this weekend.In the oven, cast iron holds the heat better than anything else.  While the batter rests, put your Lodge Logic skillet on the stove, lay in 2 or 4 strips of bacon and fry \\'em up good and crisp.  Butter will burn at these temperatures and the delicate flavor will cook out, so save the butter for when your Johnnycake comes out of the oven.You could even use a cooking spray, but don\\'t come crying to me if it\\'s not as good.

Cast iron is lovely to cook with.  Most cookware has trouble really searing a steak because the big slab of cold meat cools the pan down.  I\\'ve found a quick wipe with some oil on a paper towel and then drying upside down in a warm oven for a hour is perfect.  The traditional handle is too short for a good grip on such a big pan.  It has certain unique strengths that are particularly well suited to fry pans and dutch ovens, for certain kinds of cooking.  This pan is the perfect size to make a fried egg, and thanks to the pre-seasoned surface, egg doesn\\'t stick to the surface and it is very easy to clean.

I have found that cooking with cast iron makes food taste better.  I have to say though, it is very different than cooking with a regular teflon pan.  Cast iron gets very hot and maintains a steady hot temperature.  Overall, I\\'m happy with my purchase though and plan on getting a couple more cast iron pans SAUTE, BAKE, BROIL - U NAME IT - U CAN DO IT.keep it well oiled after use - unless you want to eat rust.  Good starer size (10.25\") for someone just starting out with a cast iron skillet.  It is okay to wash with warm water and a very mild soap & brush every once in a while (which you want to do because oil can go rancid after even a short time and it will affect the pan\\'s quality).Deep enough for simply frying, but not for doing large meats or dough items.  This skillet seems to be working great so far.  I did have to re-season it after go it because it started to rust This is my first time using cast iron and I LOVE IT!!!  These pans are already pre-seasoned so you only need to rub a bit of shortning on the surface after each use.  I use the 8\" pan for bacon, eggs and small items and the 10\" griddle makes great pizza and pancakes.  Food cooked in cast iron just tastes so much better than food cooked in anything else.  It goes from stove top to oven and you can use a variety of cooking methods from baking, broiling, frying to braising, roasting and grilling.  We got the Lodge 15\" cast iron skillet for camping trips because we have a large family.  Well I decided to take the plunge and order a few cast iron pans to compliment the one that i had already had and boy am i happy.  I recommend cast iron pans to everyone these days, and Lodge is a great and affordable brand.  really though this thing is awesome, good quality, nice heft, I cook everything on it.  I was glad to find this very large size iron skillet.  Steaks are even great in this skillet.  This skillet will get hot enough and hold the heat....that is so important.  Prior to  purchasing the 15 inch skillet I only had a 10 inch chicken fryer in cast iron.  I loved it but it was not large enough  to saut&eacute; or pan fry chicken, fish, etc for the size of my family without doing it in batches.  I love the size of this pan.  Although my electric, ceramic top stove does not have a burner this large, it has still done a great job due the excellent way in which cast iron conducts heat.  \"The cast iron skillet cookbook\", by Sharon Kramis is great to go with this pan.  I bought some inexpensive nylon brushes and clean with hot water and NO SOAP.  Lodge skillets truly are one of the last great bargains in cookware.  the non-stick patina that\\'s developed over months/years of use, the substantial heft of each piece, the rustic beauty, and most of all, that unmistakable delicious flavor that only cast iron can impart.I recently added two of these 8\" skillets to my collection.  I had been eyeing them for my daily single-sized omelets (I plan to wait until the skillets are a bit more seasoned before attempting to cook eggs in them), but every day I think of countless new uses for them.  But, they come in so handy as junior companions to my 12\" workhorse skillet and my two-burner reversible grill/griddle, I am happy to make up lost time with these little gems.At $10 and change, I recommend you purchase as many as there are members of your family.  Then ask for two more for Christmas, so you can add a fun, gourmet twist to your dinner parties.As with all cast iron, even though this is pre-seasoned, it\\'s a good idea to season it again yourself before using.  Generally you don\\'t use soap or detergent on cast iron (and NEVER put cast iron in the dishwasher!!  ), but when I first get a new piece, I hand-wash it with hot water and a tiny drop of mild dish soap.  The more you use it (or if you want, you can repeat the above seasoning process), the more non-stick it will become.With proper care, cast iron will become your most well-loved cookware.  I\\'m so excited to have added two of these 8\" skillets to my Lodge cast iron collection and can\\'t wait to come up with even more uses for these adorable, super-handy little skillets!  Absolutely fantastic for frying eggs; nothing sticks and this will redefine the taste of your food.  I am new to the whole iron pan world.  i have an induction cooktop and this is perfect for  this type of cooking w/o spending a fortune on  a small pan.  i do not find the pre-seasoned coating particularly good but i wash and season my pans after each use.  Deals change all the time at Amazon so it may or may not be true when you read this but it certainly is worth checkingWhat is the difference - well there is a boy scouts logo on the bottom of the pan.  This is a great pan at a great price its a cast iron lodge product.  Specifically, you absolutely cannot go wrong with Lodge cast iron.  It is preseasoned and ready to cook a great meal for you right out of the box.  Cast iron does require different upkeep than other cookware.  It is easy to clean while it is still hot from the stove, so a little adjustment to your cooking routine is all that is really required.  It\\'s held up for quite a while and the seasoning (original+time added) provides better non-stick cooking than my Teflon coated pans.It also does a great job evening out the pan\\'s temperature.  The pre-seasoned skillet makes getting into it very easy.  I briefly lost the seasoning for one reason or another, but with some work I got it back and this little guy rarely leaves my stove top.  This skillet does wonders and makes my steaks the way I like them amount other things I cook on this pan.  I love that it is easy to clean and it can be used on any stove top, over a fire and in the oven.  And being cast iron, it\\'s also heavy.  They\\'re from people who know this product and they\\'re straight-forward.So with the negatives out of the way, I have to say that we love this skillet!  Fried chicken, steaks, chuck roasts, you name it.For steaks, just crank up the heat to max, (we have a gas stove, so electric might be different), put a little oil, salt, and pepper on the steaks, and put them in for 3 minutes uncovered.  Simple and delicious.About the only thing we don\\'t cook in this skillet is eggs.  This pan is a great size for cooking 4 to 6 scrambled eggs or one grilled sandwich.  The more you use it, the more seasoned it becomes and food barely sticks.  made fried chicken in it and iron skillets do make things taste better and I am a very picky eater love it I\\'ve cooked so much with this skillet, I don\\'t even know where to start!  When washing this, try to limit soap, doesn\\'t really need it unless you cooked something with color in it, just wipe it clean for the next use..  I debated getting a cast iron pan for some time and read the reviews of the lodge products and most seemed very satisfied.  I\\'ve owned this cast iron skillet going on 4 years now and it\\'s just great.  I think there\\'s a bit of nostalgia and obsession brewing with some of these reviews but honestly this pan delivers and from what I\\'m told, it\\'s a healthier surface on which to cook.  Growing up my folks had cast iron skillets that were just plain abused.  If you\\'re a person who doesn\\'t clean pans until the next day or several days later, don\\'t bother with this pan, you\\'re too lazy to own one.This item comes pre-seasoned from the factory and let me tell you it\\'s a fine start that just improves with use and proper care.  I bought the Lodge brush when I ordered this pan and I\\'m still using that same brush, it\\'s almost time for another but it\\'s a good buy too.  My favorite thing to cook is simple breakfast potatoes, it browns them well and I use a lid from another pan set that fits perfectly.  My skillet has served me well and I\\'m going to buy a smaller one and eventually replace all teflon surfaces with cast iron.  ;-)One thing to be aware of is the way cast-iron reacts with garlic and vinegar.  It wasn\\'t the most appealing color as it reminded me of food-gone-bad but I read later its a natural reaction between the iron surface, the sulphur in the garlic and the vinegar.If you buy this pan, consider the slip-on handle pad and definitely buy the stiff brush from Lodge.  Just make sure to keep it seasoned so nothing sticks This is a true cast iron skillet.  It has a nice weight to it, heats evenly and cooks food to perfection.  I am sure with the high quality of cast iron this skillet is made from, I can hand this down to my daughter.  My food tastes better especially my steaks because I can put the cast iron in the broiler.  Also because the cast iron allows for the meat to be evenly cooked throught out the entire pan no matter where the heat source is.  This pan is a very nice size and the only downside to that is that it\\'s difficult for me to lift it in/out of the oven one handed like I used to do with my old skillet.  I use this primarily to make pan-seared steak, and it works perfectly for that purpose!I would definitely recommend this product!  I love cooking with cast iron (wish I still had all my mom\\'s old pans...) and starting to rebuild my collection.Wanted something larger that what I had so I got this 12&#34; - and it is bigger than I thought!  Love using it for &#34;range to oven&#34; recipes.Would also make a great deep dish pizza pan, thought I prefer my 17&#34; cast iron pan for that :)Lodge makes great products that will last a lifetime with the proper care.  The only trouble I have ever had with cast iron cookware is getting the seasoning right.  My goodness I love this pan.  Your flame (or other heat source) should be about the size of the bottom of the pan.  If you like cast iron, and I really do (I really don\\'t like eating Teflon) this is an outstanding pan for an outstanding price.  I use this skillet way more than anything else in my well-supplied kitchen arsenal.  People have different approaches to cleaning cast iron - I personally use a brush and soap and water and just re-season the pan every so often.  The price of Lodge cast iron can\\'t be beat, but the low price doesn\\'t mean compromised quality.  I used to think that the best cookware is anodized aluminum Calphalon with the most advanced non-stick surface.  Well, there still is a place for those expen$ive pans, but old-fashioned cast-iron cookware is now my favorite.I already had the 12\" skillet and the rectangular grill pan, and decided to get this one because it\\'s only [...], even though the 12\" pan would probably do what this one would.  Well, for the price, I like having this size -- I cook for one and it\\'s perfect for 2 pork chops.  To give you an idea of size, two pork chops fit perfectly in the pan, and 3 pork chops make it very crowded.Cast iron is as non-stick as it needs to be.  Chicken breasts, steaks, burgers, chops all turn out well when cooked in this pan because the pan holds its heat and sears in the juices.  I put water into the pan after cooking (after it has cooled down a bit), eat my meal, and then use a scouring pad without soap to clean the pan.  Then I heat the pan up a bit, put a small amount of oil in the pan when it is dry and hot and wipe it around with a paper towel, leaving a very thin coating of oil.For the price, [...], you can\\'t go wrong -- if you are cooking for more than one though I recommend the 12\" pan.  This versatile 6-1/2\" cast-iron skillet is for smaller cooking tasks, perfect for two eggs or bacon fried potatoes for one serving.  Pre-seasoned with a vegetable oil formula and ready for immediate use...\\nCast-iron construction heats slowly and evenly, keeps heat longer, use on low/med heat setting.  Really enjoying this pan for browning, searing foods, especially chopped onions.  Bought this pan specifically for cooking scallops and it has not disappointed.  I cook for myself, so this little skillet is the perfect size for 3-egg omelet in the morning, or veggie saute for dinner.  I am a small to medium sized female w/ skinny arms, but this skillet is not too heavy so I can still lift it w/ one arm.  It\\'s not really non-stick because the eggs won\\'t easily slide off the pan like they would from a good new non-stick pan, but it\\'s much much better compared w/ my stainless steel skillets.  As long as you soak the pan in water after cooking, by the time you finish your meal, the food residue can be easily washed off with a brush or sponge.  I use a nylon dish brush with hot water and cleaning is very fast and easy.  The skillet is relatively heavy but even with my small hands it still feels as if the handle only fits half of my palm, so it forces your hand to hold it really close to the hot pan - really bad design.  It has turned into a multi use pan and I love it This was my first cast iron skillet.  I am now hooked on cast iron and love this 12\" skillet and the 8\" skillet.  We use this skillet now more than any other pan in the house.We both love this cast iron skillet.  This is a great iron skillet and the perfect size.  ...first off dont even attempt to fry eggsin this skillet for at least 2 weeks of using....when i recived mine i washed well in hot water, even tho it seasoned your gonna wanna do it theright way...after washing put on top stove to dry,then cooked bacon in it, you are gonna wanna useanimal fat as much as possiable.....it did stick but thats toobe expected with first time use, then i towel dryedthe extra grease and added lard....put in oven at 500degrees, expect some smoking, just have fans ready, for1 hr...turn oven off, i did this like 3-4 times...thencooked fried potatoes with onions ,worked great, friedan egg and it slid off pan...great pan, just got dutch oven too...  I prepare a lot of stir-fry requiring even cooking at high temperatures, and have not needed a wok.  My brother is a big cast iron fan, he has two Lodge cast iron pans which he has owned for years.So I decided to get one, since he would always make great steaks, chops, omelettes, and potato\\'s in his.My new pan (I got the 12 inch) arrived quickly and safely packaged.  These ones from Lodge are pre-seasoned, so you\\'re ready to go as soon as it arrives.  Some people like to do an extra seasoning coat anyways, but I didnt bother and it made no difference.My first attempt was to fry a ribeye by pan frying it quickly on each side and then puting it in a high temp oven for a few minutes to finish it (for the recipe I used Google - Alton Brown\\'s cast iron ribeye recipe).  While my steak was resting, I quickly scrubbed my pan with some warm water and salt.  Again, I scrubbed and re-oiled my pan while it was still warm.Im pleased with how easy it is to clean, and how mine has already turned black and shiny, and non-stick.The trick is to follow the care guidelines, these things rock.I think I might get a 2nd one so I can do steaks/chops and sides at the same time.5 Stars.  if you like to cook like we do, ya just gotta have one of these and it\\'s pre-seasoned so you don\\'t have to do that part of a new cast iron skillet.  This is a great piece of cooking gear for our kitchen.  It\\'s small but enough for about 3 fried eggs or one grilled cheese at a time.It came pre-seasoned but it looked like it needed a bit more work so I oiled it up and put it in a hot oven, which I then turned off but left shut and the next morning the little pan was ready to go.It cooked well and washed up well after that.  I like the little loops on the Lodge Logic pans, I hang them over my wood stove when not in use and they look very nice.  This skillet is too large to use on my indoor stove.  Usually a dap of coconut oil for lube and low heat and the even distribution makes easy work of it.  The more I read, the more I am convinced that cooking with these synthetic pans may be dangerous to health.I used cast iron for years and only quit because I heard it destroys vitamin c.\\nUnless you need one this big I might suggest a smaller one, maybe 10&#34;.What I love about this pan is that it is pre-conditioned.  What I like about the big one is that it can be used for smaller things, whereas a small one cannot be used for bigger things.One thing I\\'d like to see is an option to get it shipped with a fitted leather or silicone handle pad as if you cook on higher heat for a while the handle WILL GET HOT.  I do have a handle pad somewhere, that I used with my old (smaller) cast iron pan, I just have to find it.  I\\'ll have to check.But ALL cast iron pan handles get hot and I suggest you buy a handle pad and get in the habit of using it.  just beware of the different method of cleaning for these iron skillets or an iron cook items.  I didn\\'t expect it to be that big, I think a 10in skillet would have been better but this is great for making lunch/dinner.  I never get that from my normal skillets.It is heavy and always careful not to drop it, I\\'m ok if it breaks but I am afraid of losing my toes haha..good thing it has a handle!Cleaning is a breeze too!  I clean it with soap and sponge then completely dry it, that spray it with PAM then wipe the excess oil off and heat it for a while and then store.  It is a bit heavy and don\\'t think you could flip food, but it cooks food faster than my other pans.  One of the things I love to do is to make an entire meal in a skillet.  Arrived on time, well packagedIs as describedThis is one HEAVY skillet!  so be prepared to deal with the weightThat aside, it will be just what you need to fry chicken, deep enough and the heat will be well distributedIf you already have the Dutch oven, you have a lid that will fit this skillet.  These pans are great if you take care of them.  The only reasonable complaint I\\'ve seen posted that doesn\\'t apply to broken pans or other such one-time issues is that the cooking surface is much more pitted than older pans.  It only takes  a couple of minutes (other than the re-seasoning) and will be the only difference between this pan and a very expensive cast iron pan put out by other brands in the fancier stores.  Easy enough just to wipe it off when I\\'m done with it, then I rinse and scrub it without soap in hot water right before I use it again (I use it a lot) so I don\\'t have to worry about rust between uses.  Great price for something that will last forever, gives food amazing flavor, browns things to perfection.  This is a great preseasoned cast iron skillet.  This is the quintessential cast iron pan everyone should own.  Lodge has excellent quality, and this is the perfect size to start with.I would avoid cheaper cast iron as they tend to be irregularly formed and heat differently across the pan, which can ruin what you\\'re cooking.  I was raised by a dinner-from-the-box type of family, so cooking with cast iron was an entirely new concept for me.  In fact, I find myself using these far more than the non-stick skillets we purchased around the same time.I\\'ve had no problems with rusting due to following instructions, which is always important.  I also made an attempt to watch some how-to videos off YouTube, which helped tremendously as well (Alton Brown has some handy ones on there).When I first used these, food did stick quite a bit, despite using oil, so I decided to start applying oil after each use.  I now am in the habit of rinsing/scrubbing when I\\'m done, I dry it down and then heat it back up on the stove as I apply a thin layer vegetable-based oil, which seems to make it more non-stick.  Not a must-do sort of thing, since it\\'s already pre-seasoned, but I\\'m loving the results.  I just received this skillet today....did a quick wash with plain hot water, dried it, put it on stove...then proceeded to fry up a catfish dinner!  Spent the last hour cleaning out my cupboards and I filled up my trash can tonight with 3 yr old &#34;green fry pans&#34; that performed lousy and a chipped, rusted and cracked enamel-lined-cheap-China-knockoff dutch oven.  This great Lodge skillet has a new home on the back burner of my stove.  It\\'s big heavy cooks great last forever what else could you ask for.  Make sure you want a big, heavy skillet before you order this one.  We gave away our older set of cast iron ware when we decided to lighten our kitchen utensils for camping.  Nothing beats a real cast iron skillet from Lodge.  I do get stuff burned on (not like my non-stick pans) - but it cleans pretty easily.  I am convinced that this is a great product and that\\'s the reason why the chicken comes out so good.  Well seasoned, I put a little oil in it, let it heat up and made a whole breakfast from potatoes, grilled tomatoes and of course eggs.  It worked great, no sticking, potatoes turned nice and brown, eggs perfect all on medium heat.Then the test.....clean up.  Now 40 breakfasts later....each better than the next.I just love it and do not have to worry about non-stick coating health hazards.Just to show you new is not always better.  Clean immediately after cooking and just coat with a little oil for the next one.  This is good quality and will be a pan that I use for a very LONG time to come.  Anyone interested in buying quality cast iron cookware should consider this company.  This is a fairly small skillet, 8 inch, which is the right size for some things.  The sides are fairly tall for a small skillet (1.75 inch by my measurement, inside measurement), which I consider to be a good thing.  This is pre-seasoned and is ready to use right out of the box.  As far as cooking performance, it\\'s cast iron so it\\'s great.  I also like that a cast iron lid is available for this pan.  I hesitated many years to buy cast Iron.  This skillet is  a perfect size for my family.  I did  not buy a cast iron lid for this--prefer the Lodge tempered glass lid for use on top of the stove.  I do not use soap, run hot water in it after cooking and clean it  with warm water and the Lodge scrubber brush.  I love this pan!!  !I use this for broiling & roasting food in the oven, for roasting seeds and flour on the stove, and for normal stove top uses.  It is HEAVY, but I just keep it in the bottom drawer of my oven.SEASONING AND CLEANING:Before using it the first time I did a quick \\'seasoning\\' technique I learned from my wok: take green onion ends, chopped up and saute them rubbing them around the pan \\'till they\\'re burned.For cleaning, I just use hot water and a scrub brush...\\nWe use this pan every single day.  We also use it for other everyday cooking and some baking.  I also bought a HUGE version of this pan for when we have company and are cooking a higher volume of food.  This skillet was the perfect size.  She says they are high quality and she can now cook all of her pork chops at one time!  About the only thing I wish this skillet had was a longer handle which is why I gave it four instead of five stars.  We needed a larger cast iron skillet and this is perfect.  Can\\'t beat that it\\'s made in the USA - it had the little card stating this, and I\\'ve noticed people ask this question on other cast iron products so I thought I\\'d mention it here just in case this interests you.  This pan should work great in our large Big Green Egg ...  I cannot believe it took me so many years to discover the utter joy of cooking with cast iron - I have gotten rid of all my other pans.  Cast iron has changed my life and my cooking habits - and the Lodge pans are a wonderful quality.  I have used my new lodge skillet a couple of times and so far love it!  Easy to clean...hot water (no soap), plastic brush & dry very well.  This 15\" skillet easily fit 12 chicken thighs, browned and then baked with lots of vegetables and sauce.  Plan to gradually transition to all Lodge cookware, for reasons of excellent quality & value, safe & healthy cooking...and buying American-Made.  I love this Cast Iron Skillet!  I love this Cast Iron Skillet!  When done washing with hot water (I make sure I use rubber gloves, so you don\\'t get burn!)  I dry it with a dish cloth or paper towels and spray some Pam on it, butter flavor!  I love my Lodge Cast Iron cookware.  Some of it is more than forty years old, and still going strong.The 4 star rating is for the write-up.When I needed a 12-inch cooking surface for adapting some recipes to cast iron, I had a D\\'oh Moment.  The cooking surface is considerably smaller.I\\'d like to see more information in the Product Details.And, I\\'ll be buying the 15-inch skillet.  &lt;sigh> I grew up using cast iron skillets and my family members all have them so I suddenly realized it was weird that I\\'d never bought one for myself!  This one said it came pre-seasoned which meant something different than I was envisioning.  Anyway, it cooks just fine so it\\'s all good but yeah, not quite like ma\\'s.  B/c the pan is so large, the heat distribution doesn\\'t work well on a normal stove, so it gets really hot in the center but not enough heat on the side.  I have always liked Lodge cast iron.  This is good for fitting the skillet in the oven or inside the bbq grill cover, but not good for leverage to lift the pan.  The iron skillet is what your grandparents and their parents cooked with every day.Technology has yet to duplicate the results obtained from this simple and inexpensive item.  No other cookware can do eggs on the range, fried chicken on the BBQ grill, fajitas on an open pit fire and bake a potatoe casserole in the oven.The perfect gift for young families just getting started.  Especially non-enameled cast iron.  First and foremost, yes the IRON quality is a little lower than 25 -100 years ago.  So let\\'s accept this fact and move on.The pan is good for egg frying, sautes, veggie sears, and CORNBREAD.  Again the 1-star gang, are all newbies and not skilled with using CAST IRON, so their reviews are based on their ignorance.  Then let final cool down, and wash with rag, a a little dish soap, OR USE A MILD SCRUB BRUSH ( NYLON, NOT COPPER) ( no scrubbing, or immersion), just simple sink wash, and NEVER  put CAST IRON, that is NOT enameled, in dishwasher.  Just needs a little more care than our Grandma\\'s Lodge.AND PLEASE DRY IMMEDIATELY, WITH A TOWEL.  Combined with glass lid (Amazon suggested lid making my getting a good fit an easy process), this produces consitand results on foods that I would otherwise grill.  But this pan and lid produces awesome results after enduring the several minutes it takes for the burner to heat up.  As necessary, add about teaspoon of olive oil or equvilent to pan and rub into pan surface with paper towel (clean rag would be better) in order to keep pan &#34;seasoned&#34;.  My friend had talked about wanting a cast iron pan for ages and she was thrilled when she opened the box.  The Lodge LMS3 Mini Skillet (3.5&#34;) is perfect for one egg.  My husband prefers his breakfast sandwich NOT have egg hanging over the edges of the english muffin (silly, I know, but it\\'s the truth) and this pan makes the perfectly sized egg.  I allow it to cook a bit more than usual on the first side so it stays together when flipped with a mini spatula and voila, a perfectly sized fried egg for one perfectly sized egg sandwich.It is supposed to arrive pre-seasoned, but like all cast iron cookware, it works best now that I\\'ve seasoned it myself.  Best to simply wipe out the skillet after each use and if you feel you MUST wash it, best to dry it immediately.Cheers!=^..^= I can\\'t say enough good things about the pre-seasoned cast iron.  It is especially helpful to people who are new to using cast iron.  Once you get used to using cast iron and find out how it retains heat and cooks great, you will love it.  If necessary use a brush to loosen anything left on the pan, rinse with hot water (do NOT use soap)and dry.  While the pan is still warm from the hot water, smooth a thin layer of shortening over it and wipe off excess with a paper towel.  Pre-seasonedAccording to the enclosed label that accompanied this product, that use of oil may be necessary for the first couple of times to prevent food from sticking.  Food did stick once or twice in the beginning.However, after getting acclimated to this skillet it\\'s really easy cleaning it each and every time.  Sometimes I just have to wipe it clean with a paper towel and sometimes I just use soap and water, wipe quickly and just &#34;season&#34; it for next time.  I am continuing to add more cast-iron products in my kitchen as I replace the teflon products.  This is the bad boy of all bad boys.Deep enough to fry up fish/chicken/chops/etc, yet large enough for sausage, bacon, or eggs.It\\'s very well constructed, and will last a lifetime with proper cast iron care.The more you use it, the better things taste.  If you want cast iron, you can\\'t go wrong with this skillet.  Perfect size for cooking for one - use the 10\" for two.  These pans for forgiving because the thick and heavy size, which evens out the heat.  I can\\'t understand why people would pay so much money for Teflon-coated pans when seasoned cast iron cookwares are just as non-sticking and are so much less expensive.  I love to cook and I bought this for certain recipes and it is really wonderful.  The trick to cast iron skillets is to get them hot before cooking.  THe more you use it, the better it becomes.Perfect size for two fried eggs!  However, I had none in this size range; ordered the Lodge Logic skillet based on reviews and I am not disappointed.  This was my first experience with a Lodge pre-seasoned skillet, and having read some reviews of the Lodge pre-seasoned finish, I wasn\\'t certain I would like it.  It is true that the finish of these pans is not mirror-smooth like the perfectly seasoned and maintained cast iron pans of yesteryear, but that is mainly an aesthetic difference, not a practical one.  The surfaces of both are nearly non-stick, and the evenness of the temperature, heat-retention, and durability make them far preferable to teflon-coated non-stick pans.  For searing of meat and other high-temperature cooking, there is nothing that can compare to cast iron.  This size is perfect for so many uses; its quality and durability make it a bargain.  Very useful  Makes great grilled cheese sanwiches.  Evenly sautes onions in prep for making other dishes I love my Lodge skillet.  I have a 12\" cast iron skillet and was looking for one a couple of inches larger.  I\\'ve used this skillet many times and have to re-season it after every use, and I followed instructions when it arrived.  I have a pre-seasoned biscuit pan that has held its seasoning with no problem, so I\\'m mostly disappointed in this skillet.  this is a great pan, but beware, it is really heavy!  It\\'s heavy (but not too heavy since it\\'s just a 9&#34; pan), retains heat perfectly and is pre-seasoned.  I also got the hot pad handle which I think is mandatory (otherwise you might just reach out to move the hot pan and get burned).  Its an iron skillet, and its was such an affordable expense!  Great product, took a while to convince my wife to get into cast iron cooking however now that she is on board we will be switching to all cast iron.  Stop buying lousy and potentially dangerous pots and pans from China and get yourself some genuine made in America cast iron.  But keep them dry with a light coating of vegetable oil ( olive oil works great ) and its better than teflon.  The 10 1/4 inch is a good size for many things and fits well on a large burner.  Keep in mind if you go bigger the pan will be that much heavier.I use the pan for making Swedish pancakes, and cast iron is the only type of pan you will find an authentic Swedish pancake cooking in.  Much thinner than the traditional pancake.The only thing I don\\'t like about the pan is that it didn\\'t come with a handle insulator.  I know this is a per-seasoned pan, but I figured the factory coating would be a bit \"mass-produced\" at best, so added a coat of my own before using it.  The pan is great, very good quality and very heavy.  but it seems good and sturdy for a cast iron.  make sure to read up on how to care for cast iron pans if you are new to the material.  they can not be used like regular pans I love ourLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet!  For us, it is an essential piece of equipment.TheLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet, a classic skillet, belongs in many kitchens.  It is wise to buy theLodge Logic 10-1/4-Inch Cast-Iron Lidwith it to make cooking in a skillet safe and to increase the verstility of this skillet.We have used our skillet extensively, especially in recipe development for Flavored with Love: Mary Lou\\'s Family and Friends Can Cook and The Collard Patch.  Here is another cornbread recipe  developed with our Lodge skillet:Butter Pecan CornbreadIngredients1 stick ( pound) unsalted butter1 cup chopped pecans1 tablespoon canola oil1 cups self-rising cornmeal mix1 cup self-rising flour teaspoon baking powder1 cup milk3 eggs, beaten2 tablespoons honeyPreparation--In a small saucepan melt the butter with the pecans in it.  Heat the skillet with the oil in it.--Combine the dry ingredients.--Add the remaining ingredients.--Spoon the batter into the hot skillet.--Bake 10-12 minutes.One of the problems people seem to have with the skillet is sticking.  I have sprayed it generously with Pam(PAM-Original No Stick Cooking Spray, 3/8oz Cans) to cook other foods and had great results.Every meal we cook would present some opportunity to use the iron skillet, but we don\\'t use it every day because we have become leery of cooking a large amount of our food in iron.  We are trying to protect our heart health, and there has been much concern lately about cooking in iron pots and pans.  (Another more sinister but rare risk is possible damage to the liver.)  We don\\'t allow these warnings to keep us from using our skillet to make our favorite cornbreads, to cook steaks effortlessly with great results, to broil salmon, to cook fajitas, and to saute onions.  I am loving my cast iron.  I am loving my cast iron.  I just washit as soon as it cools in hot water, dry it, andspray it with oil so its ready to go when neededkeeping it non-stick.  This pan might infuriate you for the first couple of weeks you have it (even if you season it on your own) but once you get a nice coating on there it becomes a great everyday pan.  A nice coat of oil every few weeks keeps it looking and working like a vintage cast iron pan at a quarter of the price.  Love it...this is my favorite pan.I had one in a different size for years.Bought this larger one and it is just as great.Very heavy, heats evenly, cooks everything great.Good deal on amazon.BONUS it is made here in the USA.Highly recommend this...you will have it for the rest of your life.  The idea of non-stick cast iron comes from the interior finish being smooth and seasoned.  I took the roughness down with 120 grit then 220 grit sandpaper, then seasoned it twice, and now it\\'s easy to use and works well.  But this took me over two hours to sand alone.In the end, I\\'d opt for a vintage, turn of the century pan like a Wagner on eBay...you\\'ll pay a bit more for it, but it will be truly non-stick, and you\\'ll most likely be eating off a pan that cooked a meal for some burly pioneer dude.  It\\'s huge, and, well, how much is there to say about a chunk of iron that you heat up and cook stuff in.  Huge and heavy, this pan heats evenly and holds lots of food, which is the reason I bought it.  I\\'m not sure why but 10\" of cast iron just looks small.  I am a complete cast-iron convert and own about 7-8 main cooking pieces.  Size is a major issue when deciding on a pan--This is the right pan for:--Side dishes for a family--Main dishes for a single person--cornbreadThis is not the right size for you:--if you have a very large family and want to make sides/main dishes in itAs with all lodge products, this is well made and, with the right care, will last more than a lifetime.  I own one non-lodge cast iron skillet and it has developed a hairline crack in it.  The final state of matter, even stars*, has to be good as cookware.  *In case you didn\\'t know, once any star has burned up all its other material and starts to make iron, it\\'s headed for nova -- death.  I bought my first cast iron piece last year...an enameled dutch oven from Ledge and I love it.  I am so excited to use this pan.  I grew up on a cast-iron pan house, and cooked a lot of moosemeat in one.  If you add things to a cold pan, they will very likely give you problems.  It wasn\\'t until the last few years that I discovered the joys of cooking with cast iron - both with Le Creuset enameled cookware and this fabulous Lodge Logic cast iron.I use cast iron to cook nearly everything - It\\'s heat retention and even cooking is superior to everything - including stainless steel - I have a few stainless steel pots, as well as cast aluminum - and nothing beat cast iron.This skillet, in my mind, is a must-have for any kitchen.  Sear it on the stove top and throw it in the oven for a quick broil - do it all in this pan.Best of all - the cheapest pan I own is the one that I use the most and will last me forever...Get this pan, you won\\'t regret it!!  Such a great investment.A lot of the 1-star reviews seem to be related to people not knowing how to properly care for the cast iron or cook with it.  If you\\'re not familiar with it, it\\'s totally different than your standard stainless or non-stick cookware.Being a nerd, I did a lot of research before I invested in cast iron and am glad I did.  Don\\'t be fooled by the idea of this pan being pre-seasoned; you\\'ll need to put in some upfront work to get good results.  If you do, you can expect it to last for year, decades even.Google Sheryl Canter and Chemistry of Cast Iron; I followed this method and had no issues with food sticking from the very first use, cornbread mind you.I also recommend investing in some steel wool, coarse salt, and a sturdy brush (I use bamboo).  The steel wool is good if your pan rusts, the salt is great for cleaning residue and the bamboo brush is excellent for tough stuck on food debris.  My only other piece of advice is to let the pan cool before getting it wet to clean it.I would definitely by more Lodge products, this one doesn\\'t disappoint.  They say no soap, and I have a 12 inch that looks like new....I use a scotchbrite scrub sponge to wash it in dawn, and rinse it really, really well...then put it on the stove and heat the pan to hot...turn off burner, and pore a little vegetable oil in the pan, and take a paper towel and make sure you cover bottom and inside sides with this oil.  Just let it sit on stove till has cooled...it is again pre-seasoned and ready for use.  The heat completely dries the pan out, to prevent rust...and it keeps the pan looking like new.Once you have tasted fried chicken done in a iron pan with \\'shortening\\' not oil....you will never use anything else to cook chicken, except maybe a deep frier...I LOVE IT!  If you\\'re into cast iron cooking, this brutal hunk of metal will do the job with no apologies.  If you\\'re at all curious about cast iron cooking then this is a no brainer.Heavy enough to use as a weapon in the event a burglar breaks in to steal your steak and eggs.  I have several cast-iron products including a wok, grill pan and a couple of Dutch ovens.  I have a full set of All Clad stainless frying pans that are somewhat non-stick if you know how to use them.  I\\'ve heard so much about Grandma\\'s priceless iron frying pan that I had to give it a try.  I guess I\\'ll get used to these problems and learn to appreciate the ultimate cooking surface that iron provides.  Every size of pan requires some amount stirring because of hot spots.  They turned out great, and everyone was served hot hash browns at the same time!  It is exactly what it is suppose to be...a huge, heavy, cast iron skillet that is great for large meals.  I enjoy caring for my cast iron and enjoy learning how to.  I already own a 12-inch Lodge Logic pre-seasoned cast-iron skillet but always found it too large for a lot of applications, too heavy, and too slow to heat up properly.  This 8-inch skillet is perfect for making individual omelettes or cooking up smaller batches of vegetables, potatoes, etc.  Since the 8-inch diameter refers to the lip of the pan, the actual cooking surface is smaller than 8-inches so I can\\'t imagine getting the 6 1/2-inch skillet for anything other than a novelty item.On one last note, the pre-seasoning is actually not too bad and I was able to make some great eggs on my first use without them sticking.  Everyone here has their different way of cleaning cast-iron so I\\'ll add mine: after cooking and when the pan is still hot/warm, sprinkle in about 1Tbsp of kosher salt and rub this around the pan with a paper towel to scrape away any thing that\\'s left in the pan.  Dump out the salt (careful, it\\'ll be hot) into the sink/trash, then add a little bit of cooking oil to the pan and spread it around using the same piece of paper towel.  This little skillet is fantastic, as you would expect from Lodge.  I mostly use this for hot dips - keeps the dip warm for at least an hour without cords or flame - awesome for Game Day - by the time it\\'s cool, the dip is gone.  Also perfect for cooking a couple of eggs, but beyond fairly single-serve cooking, this skillet is a bit too small to be a work-horse.I Also have the 8 inch skillet, and that size is a bit more versatile - large enough to grill a sandwich or a couple of chicken breasts.  He feels confident that I bought a pan that could be used in another 80 years.There is no insulating handle, so make sure you have potholders or oven mitts - the pan gets hot and retains the heat for a while.  Also, be sure to follow the care instructions: this pan needs to be seasoned after use.  Very different from the other stuff you use daily, but this heats fast and hold very even heat to whatever your cooking.  There is simply no better pan for certain uses than a genuine American cast iron skillet.  Love this pan and use it all the time.  So, this was the first Cast-Iron Pan I bought, It did everything so well from day one, that I had to add the Lid - do not buy this without the lid.  Now, I still use by Anodized pans too, but when I work with heavy meats and juices, the cast iron is the beast.  I love my Lodge cast iron skillet.  I love my Lodge cast iron skillet.  Just be sure to take good care of it and always coat it with oil after you clean it so it doesn\\'t rust!  My mom had a 12\" cast iron frying pan that she constantly used when I was growing up.  Despite the grossness the food always came out great so I didn\\'t complain.This lodge pan seems like a mini version of my mom\\'s.  ;-)The pan is just about perfect for cooking for one or making a side dish.  Never use soap, wipe out the grease and then wash in hot water.  Put about a teaspoon of cooking oil on a paper towel and rub the oil all over the pan after you towel dry it.6.  Cast iron should work on most cook tops, even induction.9.  After reading all the glowing posts about seasoned cast iron, you\\'d wonder why anyone was ever persuaded to buy that nasty Teflon stuff when they already owned (back in the 50s and 60s) the  perfect non-stick pan.  Well I bought this pan and it hasn\\'t been that great for me.  From reading on the web, apparently until the 70s cast iron skillets were machined inside to a smooth finish, but the interior these days is left pretty much the way it comes out of the iron casting.  I\\'ve tried seasoning the pan in the oven with the techniques you can read about on the web, in Alton Brown\\'s books, etc and nothing has given me a smooth slick surface on the bottom.  I guess I thought that that ranges for home use just weren\\'t hot enough to get restaurant quality food.  I don\\'t think enough people know how good cast iron is to cook with and settle for substandard cookware like I did.This pan is heavy and pretty much indestructible, unlike non-stick pans that have limited useful lives.  Though it comes pre-seasoned, before using it, I washed it and baked it at 200 degrees for 2 hours after spreading Crisco on it (lard is supposed to be even better for this).  After this, it is 99% stick-free and the seasoning will just get better with time.  The cast iron retains heat much better than steel or aluminum and spreads heat more evenly, which provides superior results, even when using a lower flame.  This pan (or any Lodge product) is an excellent value and something every household should have.Since I got this pan, however, I learned about the advantages of buying second hand cast iron such as Griswold or Wagner, made from the 1850s to the 1950s, and I picked up a couple myself.  These pans are superior to modern Lodge pans (or any other current cast iron ware), but they will also be a bit more expensive (approx $50-$60 for an 11\" pan online) and usually need to be restored and re-seasoned, which requires some elbow grease.  In my experience, the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface doesn\\'t significantly impair its non-stick properties, but the smooth surface of my antique pans is far superior and much nicer to cook on.  With the Lodge\\'s pebbled surface, it\\'s not as easy to smoothly slide a stainless steel spatula under foods and it\\'s noisier, whereas with the old pans, a spatula glides effortlessly under foods.  Like many things, cast iron cookware with the quality of the old days just isn\\'t being made anymore and will likely never be again.For price, performance and easy availability, however, I don\\'t think anything beats Lodge.  The Lodge pan works great for almost all tasks.  The cast iron excels at all frying, and high temperature cooking.  Learn how to maintain this pan (oil after every use, don\\'t wash with soap only hot water, etc.)  it will give you great non-stick performance.  Lodge is simply the best I have found.The skillet is smooth and well balanced.  This time I used the pan with only a simple cleaning.  Well, I, for one, wish they made more different styles so I could stick to their product line alone.The Lodge stuff costs a bit more, but it is worth it.  **** UPDATE 2 ****I\\'m still learning how to use this wonderful pan.  I use Pam spray (not the old kind that leaves a residue), butter or olive oil while cooking, wipe it out with dry and wet paper towels immediately after removing the food, and recoat with spray and leave it on the burner to cool.  In most cases I can clean the pan so quickly my food is still hot when I sit down to eat.I now use it about as often as my nonstick skillet, although it\\'s horses for courses.If you broil steaks indoors in winter, try this: Lay some foil in the pan and shape it to fit.  If you are diligent about keeping it well-oiled and don\\'t put food in until it\\'s pre-heated, the pan behaves as if it were non-stick.I wish the main handle was longer.  The pan is so heavy it\\'s hard to move around when cleaning.  I pretty much have to leave it on the stove and wipe it out with a bunch of wet paper towels.ORIGINAL REVIEWI bought this after getting frustrated trying to cook sea scallops in a regular pan and not getting a good sear.  This is the kind of pan you need for searing meats on a stove or in an oven.It\\'s got a rough texture finish inside.  Be sure it\\'s hot and has oil or butter on it before adding food to prevent sticking.  If you clean it with soap you need to heat it and rub oil on it to restore the seasoning coat that prevents the food from welding onto it.It\\'s really heavy!  If the pan is warm (and it stays warm long after you turn off the burner) you\\'ll need potholders on both hands to move it to the sink for soaking or cleaning.I\\'m still experimenting with it, but I think it makes a great addition to the kitchen.  I use it much less often than my non-stick Circulon skillet, but it lets me do things I never could before and that\\'s sparking my creative juices.  I like being able to put it in the oven as well as use it on the stove top.My only complaint is that it is extremely heavy.  When you cook eggs in it, you have to make sure that it is very oil or the eggs will stick.  This lodge skillets work great when cooking meats.  Granted, I\\'m a newbie to cast iron, but I wanted to go that route especially for steaks and burgers cooked indoors.  I was impressed with the size and weight but I must be doing something wrong because I\\'ve never successfully cooked eggs in it without getting them stuck to the bottom of the pan (even with adding oil each time).  Cost was about the same just had to pay for tax, so like ~$3 more.Wanted to smooth the cooking surface a bit more, this what I did:First used 150 grit sandpaper and finished with 400 grit wet sandpaper.  One can sand even more[mirror like finish], but this was enough for the skillets bought and not really necessary.Wash well with soap and a scouring pad or similar.  Rinse/Dry immediately and throughly, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillets.Then re-season the skillets.  For 1 hour, let it cool down for ~30 minutes and repeat the re-seasoning process 3-5 times to get them well seasoned again.First time use was great.  The eggs did stick a little, but that is to be expected; as more seasoning/cooking is done that will be a thing of the past.For cleaning one can use a scrub brush as suggested or salt.  Cleaning with salt works great, got the idea from [0].  [0] http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKIOBGJ0W2M3/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&asin;=B0002F9AH2&cdForum;=Fx3EC6KN3NF72WV&cdMsgID;=Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6&cdMsgNo;=1&cdPage;=1&cdSort;=oldest&cdThread;=Tx36UJEPNPG0XE7&store;=home-garden#Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6Basically just pour some salt on the skillet and rub a bit[not hard, just enough to remove any stuck bits] with a paper towel.Rinse well with water [if skillet is warm/hot; use hot water], over the surface of the skillet.  Dry immediately with paper/cloth towel throughly; place back on the stove/oven to fully dry, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillet while still warm/hot.Put away in a cool dry place with a paper towel over the skillet cooking surface to prevent rust[which should not happen; just as a precaution].  this was part of a cast-iron buying frenzy i went through recently.  I didn\\'t want to ship it back since it was my own stupid fault and I\\'m a great believer that there is no such thing as useless cast iron.I use this pan mainly for making eggs in the morning or a two person portion of cornbread.  It is great for those who worry about the tough clean up involved in new cast iron.  This skillet is light and a breeze to clean.I have found that all of my Lodge cookware is versatile and very durable and easy to clean.  Cheap, healthy (you get some extra iron!  ), works really well, multifunctional (you can use it as a weapon, because it is very heavy of course).  I recommend it as a staple pan for every serious cooking.  I have been looking for another good iron skillet for a while, not findin anything in the stores that i like.  I seem to always find things on Amazon i can find anywhere else.the skillet is great heavy and already seasoned - only thing i wish it was a little bigger.Other than that a great skillet for everyday stove top and oven use.  Served me well for the last 2 months...bit too heavy for people with arthritis or spondylosis..think twice...cooks great...browns beautifully...be careful to follow the instructions and it will last u long.  Ideal for large families and those who cook for an army like myself :) Really nice quality....AND how can you beat free shipping with this?!  Like one of the other reviewers, I initially tried it out with eggs, right after receiving it...definitely stuck to the pan.  I started to cook all my greasy food in this pan, and after about a month, it improved significantly!  Today, I fried eggs with only a little cooking oil (same conditions as with my teflon frying pan), and to my surprise, the eggs didn\\'t stick!  I\\'m VERY happy I bought this, and will continue to use this for a long time.  Cleaning is actually not so bad, I scrub it out under hot water, then put it back on the stove, heat it to dry, then coat with oil.  It bubbles up & when the water settles down, I pour it out & nothing is left sticking to the pan, although I still use the Lodge Logic cast iron brush on it while under hot running water.  Everything taste better when it\\'s cooked in seaoned cast iron & this brand is durable & you have many sizes to choose from.  Pros:It heats very evenly and cooks better than any cookware I have owned.  The seasoning and patina it develops provides a natural non-stick coating.  Two hand hold required.Tips:You must have goot pot holders, as the uninsulated handles will get hot when cooking.Don\\'t scrub hard as it removes the seasoning.Don\\'t let it air dry, it will rust.Don\\'t put it in the dishwasher, as it will remove the seasoning.Leave it a little oily after you cook I use on gas stove and out door grill.  clean up couldn\\'t be easier.hot water, brush and a slight coat of vegtable oil I was happy to finally find these 6 1/2 in.  LOVE AMAZON, you\\'re my store!Rita McWhorter I\\'ve loved this pan from the moment I seasoned it, and have used it several times a week since.  The 10.25-inch is a perfect size for the 2 of us, and allows you to pretty easily cook up a couple thick, 10oz steaks (or so).  Some days I wish I had a 12&#34;, when we have company over, but this size is perfect for 2-3 people for most dishes.The cast iron requires a bit different attention than a &#34;standard&#34; pan, but I\\'ve found it definitely to be worth it and it\\'s just about developing new habits.  Its heavy, its heats really fast and it comes pre-seasoned.  I especially appreciate these small cast iron skillets by lodge.  I don\\'t have to bother with a large skillet, clean up, etc, when wanting to cook or reheat a small amount.  I bought this because a good friend who was visiting put my 100+ yr old skillet in the dishwasher.  Yes, I cried & it was all I could do not to wring her neck.I love this skillet now, but straight from the store the preseason was worthless.I have the fancy corn bread pans and their large reversible griddle.  These items came seasoned and none worked like that antique pan I thought was ruined.Another friend asked me to her camp house and she said bring all your cast iron you want to season, because you\\'ll be doing mine as well.This is what I did.Scrubbed all of it using Dawn.Dried it with flour sack towels, I buy from Sam\\'s Club.Put all the cookware on the campfire so it was definitely dry.Pulled out of the campfire, waited for it to cool enough to handle.Grabbed my bucket of lard, yes I said lard.  Started the process over again.Once I felt the insides were right, I flipped every thing over and started the process again.It did take most of the day, but I saved my 100+ yr old skillet.If you can\\'t get to a campfire, a gas or wood burning grill will do it as well, as long as it has a lid.If you don\\'t like the idea of lard, a good friend uses shortening.  If you feel the need to use soap and water definitely put in on a burner for a few minutes to make sure it\\'s dry and then use your vegetable oil of choice to smear it in every nook and cranny.Finally, spoke with a Lodge representative.  After you\\'ve used some steel wool and soap to wash it first.I think they do a huge disservice to the joy of using cast iron.  This is a very high quality pan that makes great food.  Their 12\" cast iron skillet is one of the most used items in my kitchen.  I quickly realized that for the about the same amount of money as a 14-15\" thin steel specialty paella pan, I could have this Lodge cast iron 15 1/4\" skillet, which is both more durable and more versatile.It\\'s proven to be good at paella on the grill, and is useful for cooking up a whole mess of zucchinis, or other large batches etc.  It\\'s big enough that you can make two omelets side-by-side in the thing, (though making them individually in one of the smaller skillets is easier).Like all of the Lodge cast iron cookware, this is built to last and is very easy to use and maintain.  I use this more than any other pot/pan in my collection - it is THE BEST skillet for searing meats.  Yes it\\'s heavy, but it\\'s freaking cast iron - what do you expect?  That\\'s why there are 2 handles, and use mitts for both when the pan is hot.  I use salt to clean it, similar to this method, with a few tweaks:[...]Cast iron also produces the best cornbread, so I\\'ve used it for that as well.  I just bought a Lodge cast-iron grill pan as well, can\\'t wait to use it!  It is made well, seasoned reasonably well, and I love that handle on the other side for lifting!  It is so useful and so easy to cook with.  Keep this skillet properly seasoned, and it\\'ll be your new best friend.  I quickly learned that stainless steel is not the way to go unless you want to be best friends with Pam (the cooking spray) or if you use a lot of cooking oils (butter, grease, shortening) in your foods.  Suddenly I started finding little black chips in my eggs and the interior of the skillet had all kinds of scratches as the non-stick coating was peeling.  How many grandmothers, mothers and aunt have a cast iron skillet from 20, 30, years ago?  it was all worth it.I cook pretty much everything in this skillet.  The acid from the tomato just kills the nice non-stick loving I have going in this skillet.  Besides that its a perfect size for large and small meals.I\\'ve heard of different methods for cleaning and seasoning an iron skillet.  Eggs, baked chicken, fried foods, burgers, pretty much anything you can cook.  You have to actually USE it.After I cook in it, I cleaned it with only HOT water and a really really tough nylon scrub brush.  The soap with eat away at the non-stick layer you\\'re slowing building up.Either way, after you clean it, dry it completely with a towel.  Place the skillet on the stove on high heat and use a small bit of shortening and very, very, lightly grease the interior of the skillet.  Turn off the burner and let the skillet sit while it cools.Over time, using this method every time will get you that nice non-stick layer.  I just cook on it, wash it with hot water and my scrub brush and dry it completely.  This is my first cast iron skillet and is in great condition.  It\\'s easy to clean, cooks my food evenly.  Even though the reviews had mentioned this about ALL cast iron skillets, but it surprised me how heavy it was.  This is a great little pan.  This is a great little pan.  It would have been so much better.Anyway, this is great for pretty much anything you want to fry or bake.  It works well for baking in a toaster oven, too.As with all cast-iron pans (even if they\\'re pre-seasoned) expect eggs to stick the first time you cook them on it.  Pretty much everything else seems non-stick from the get-go, though.Anyway, this is a great first pan.  Good for learning the ins and outs of cast-iron.  I am very happy with this skillet and use it all the time but it is too heavy to hold with one hand by a sixty-something woman with bad joints.  Just make sure to get on the web site &#34;whatscookingamerica.net&#34; so you know how to season these skillets.  Fried chicken is the best in a cast iron skillet!  I feel safe to use this iron skillet replace my non stick coating.  We have an off-brand cast iron pan, and the Lodge one is definitely better.  My husband prefers cooking with cast iron and this is the one he uses the most!  GREAT value and I will definitely buy more Lodge brand products.  If you have never used cast iron (I had not), be warned it holds heat all over so handle carefully and when using oil, be advised to use a low smoke point oil such as canola or safflower.  The 12&#34; skillet is good when you want to cook foods and not crowd your skillet but beware it is heavy.  Holds up wonderfully and even though stainless steel is my favorite cookware (learn to use it first) this is my most used pan of all lol.  The skillet is good when cooking for one.  It\\'s perfect for single serves of sausages and other small items but I\\'ve found it\\'s best use for me is roasting peppers.  dutch oven and fell in love with cast iron.  I ordered this skillet thinking the bigger size would be good to cook for my large family and I was right, but when I say it\\'s big I mean it\\'s MASSIVE (and heavy!).  I wiped it down with some flax seed oil and put it into my heated oven and it fit with very little wiggle room.  It certainly will not fit in my cabinets so it will have to live on my stove-top which is just fine by me.A lot of reviewers have complained about the \"rough\" finish on the inside of the skillet.  Don\\'t let a little texture steer you away from buying this bargain-priced skillet - you can always season, season, season to get that smooth patina cast iron is renowned for.One thing to note is that the product picture indicates that there are two pour spouts between each handle.  The size is great for my large family but if you aren\\'t cooking for a bunch of people I think this skillet may be overkill for you.  skillet.Edit: I just received the 12-in rooster pan as a gift and I am thrilled!  I use the 15 inch skillet every day but it takes up so much room on my stovetop that it is difficult to cook two things at a time.  Now I can easily use my 12 inch and 10.5 inch skillets on the stovetop while the big boy 15 incher is baking in the oven.  But then again, lots of things would be perfect if it were just a few inches longer.I will probably buy a few more of the same pans in different sizes.  This 8\" is a little too small to get a spatula in there to flip pancakes.Update: As of 9/1/2011 I pretty much only use cast iron now.  I still have some stainless steel pots, but for pans I only use these cast iron ones.  what can be better than that?Originally did not want a cast iron pan because it is not supposed to be washed with soap and water.  Whip out with a paper towel was just not enough for me.When I use this pan, I let it cool completely.  This keeps the pan nicely seasoned and bone dry.  Never a problem with rust at all, and it is indeed non-stick.Hamburgers have a wonderful crust, bacon is flat and crispy, eggs flip \"no-yokey-brokey,\" good stuff!!!  You still don\\'t want to scrape the pan with metal, but it is a lot more forgiving than a non-stick surface.I am still holding onto my Le Creuset Dutch Ovens however.  :-) But if you are looking for a dutch oven, I\\'d have no problem recommending a Lodge cast iron model.And here is another fantastic bonus:\"Cooking with cast iron fortifies your food with iron.  While cast iron doesn\\'t leach chemicals, it can leach some iron into your food...and that\\'s a good thing.  Cooking food, especially something acidic like tomato sauce in a cast-iron skillet can increase iron content, by as much as 20 times.  \"SOURCE: [...] This pan is fantastic.  Yes, cast iron is a bit heavy, and you will need a potholder as the handle will get hot as you cook.  Food tastes great, it is non-stick once properly seasoned, infuses iron into the food (good for you!)  We needed (er, wanted) a bigger cast iron skillet, so we went looking for one with good reviews and landed here.  Everything was sticking a LOT, so I just seasoned it with shortening (Google if you don\\'t know how - very easy!  ), coating the whole pan (and putting a foil-covered cookie sheet below to catch drippings.  The first few times, we made sure to cook fatty foods (bacon, ground beef), but now it is seasoned really well so we can just use a bit of spray and make anything - grilled cheese, french toast, veggies - whatever.  I have seasoned it a couple of times to get it really good and non-stick.  This is the pan I prefer for high heat searing.  However I did re-season it with a little oil and heated it for an hour in the oven.  I have not had any problems with rust.After use, I allow the pan to heat up until it is very hot.  I know Lodge recommends no soap, but I use mild soap, anyway.  I dry them after washing and when necessary, lightly coat with canola oil from a spray can.I can do anything in my cast iron pans--including flipping an omelet!Nothing beats cast iron for its superior cooking surface.  I like to cook at very high temperatures at times, either to sear meat or to caramelize vegetables and nothing handles the heat like cast iron.Be warned, however--this is a heavy pan.  Once I seasoned it (light coating of shortning and in the oven at 325 for one hour and leave there overnight to cool and repeat process one more time), food releases easily and it is a joy to  work with this skillet that heats so evenly and keeps temperature so well.  I have made pan pizza in it twice and cooked up skillet potatoes, and chicken and vegetables.  These skillets are such a tremendous bargain for how functional they are.Cleaning and care are a little different than for other cookware but no more difficult.  Scrub with a nylon brush or sponge and hot water (dishsoap optional), dry, and season with a light coating of oil and wipe with a paper towel.  I\\'m working with cast iron for the first time and this pan is great!  I do wish it was easier to clean but I haven\\'t found any cast iron that is.  Then very lightly coat it with oil.Also it best for the heat source to be under ALL the surface area of the bottom of the pan.  Go right ahead and use metal cooking utensils too.Lastly, for stovetop use, I love my skillet but not the cast iron lids as i don\\'t want to draw away heat from the cooking area.  This pan skillet is good for single fast frying dishes (no deep frying) and for preparation such as saut&eacute; for main courses.  It will take a little time before this small Pre-Season Skillet can use normally.  I even bought a real small one for eggs and small batches of cornbread.Highly recommend After struggling with a set of three regular cast iron pans from a different manufacturer, I finally boxed them up for Goodwill.  It worked like a charm with the first use -- no problems with sticking at all.  (Acutally cast iron is the only way to make good cornbread.)  Wash with hot water; Lodge does not recommend using soap.  I then heat mine on the stove top, turn off the heat, add a tablespoon of oil and use a paper towel to spread the oil on the entire pan inside and out.  After the pan cools, I wipe away any excess oil and store the pan.For anyone who wants a head start on leaving heirloom cast iron pans, I strongly suggest this product.  Sear a steak on stove top, then shove the entire pan into oven afterwards.  After about a dozen uses, it is pretty much non-stick.  I\\'ve never cooked with iron before, but I have not been disappointed.  These pans are clearly good quality heavy duty iron, and they are quite easy to cook with.  I was worried the 8&#34; would be a little small, but it has ended up being my go-to pan for a lot of things - the perfect size for heating up corn tortillas, frying side dishes, sauteeing veggies, etc.  The 12&#34; I have used less since I generally am only cooking for one or two people, but it\\'s a nice size for a bigger batch of something if I were cooking for friends and family - would be great for making a big batch of home fries or something similar.  I only have 2 10\" skillets and I have wanted to buy some new pieces for quite some time.  In particular, I have wanted to buy a 12\\' skillet, a dutch oven, and a griddle.  Lodge cast iron could very well be the best deal going in the entire cookware market.  Its not that big of a deal as seasoning cast iron is very easy but I didn\\'t know if that was something I was going to have to do or not.  The first thing I cooked was eggs and the flavor was just as good as my 20 year old pans, something I wasn\\'t expecting.For those new to cast iron, just remember a few simple rules and your pans should last forever.  Never use detergents or soap and always use hot water as rinsing a hot cast iron pan with cold water can actually cause your pans to crack.  Follow these rules and your pans will most likely outlast you.Bottom line - I am absolutely blown away by Lodge Cast Iron.  The quality is amazing, the price is amazing and the pre-seasoned pans are literally ready to go right out of the box.  Again cast iron has never been this easy.  Again cast iron has never been this easy.  I will be recommending Lodge Cast Iron to everyone I know, right after I order a few more pans.5 Stars and then some!!!  Once you have it fully seasoned, it\\'s hard to get food to stick, which means super-easy cleanup!  I have a mid-range stainless steel multiclad type set that gets a little use, but this is my go-to pan for most cooking.Pros:Conducts heat well.Easy clean up.Can cook on all surfaces, including an open flame (campfire!  )Cooks like a charm.Cons:Like all cast iron - no dishwasher!Handle gets hot.  If you need one that the handle doesn\\'t get hot on, look at the newer ones with a stainless handle.Advice:No soap, wash gently in warm water, or you\\'ll remove the seasoning and stuff will stick.Wait to wash, if you try to wash it while it\\'s hot, you will most likely crack the iron.Reseason from time to time.Overall:A hundred years tells the story, your kids kids will be using this pan.  The Lodge 8\" serving pot with iron lid is a wonderful compliment to this handy skillet.  My grandparents had Lodge cast-iron cookware and loved it.  I purchased a few pieces from Amazon in mid-March.So far, the 8&#34; skillet has seen the most use.  I will NEVER buy anything but Lodge brand cast-iron when adding to my small collection.  I do have the 5 qt Dutch oven and look forward to fixing a pot roast in it using my gas grill during the summer.All of my &#34;other brand&#34; of cast-iron has been donated to a charity store.  This pan has become my 1st choice for browning or frying...distributes the heat evenly, excellently...i don\\'t have to turn the burner up as high either.  I love that its cast iron, us ladies need the extra iron in our diets & this is a good way to get the trace amounts in our diet.  Great little pan for melting butter or cooking eggs.  It\\'s the same great quality as the larger lodge skillets.  We own several different sizes of Lodge Logic pans.  The 12-Inch one is our favorite cast iron pan.  Lodge cast iron, what a great thing.Properly seasoned and used its practically as no stick as teflon or hard anodized.  Dont expect that overnight it takes multiple uses and seasonings to get it there but when its right and its there, in my opinion it cant be beat!And as for using soap as a no no...........Well that rule was created many moons ago when soap was lye based and yeah it would eat away at your seasoning.But as for a little modern dish DETERGENT (Not dishwasher, but dish) not a problem at all.I use it from time to time if the skillet needs a little help with cleanup and no problems at all.Just clean it up quick and dont let it sit on the iron and it will be fine.After all I really cant think of a health department that would appove a restraunt using the cast iron without cleaning it with detergent!!!!  !And start out cooking on low temp and only go up as high as you need to as you learn your skillet.  That will help with the initial sticking you may encounter and keep you from burning foods.Once you learn the skillet and how it cooks, higher temps will be fine!!  There are many cast iron enthusiasts out there and I\\'m one of them.  Easy to clean, all the properties of cast iron except for the ridiculous price tag (just snag one when they\\'re on sale).  pan- seared a WHOLE chicken oven roaster in this skillet yesterday and what a beautiful crust it gave that bird!!!  We ate from it till we coldn\\'t eat no more!I anticipate cooking in this one everyday.This skillet is very generous and I did buy the lid for it, that\\'s another story/review..what another great peice to have after you season that big ol\\' lid(comes unseasoned).  Helper handle is a must cause it\\'s impossible to carry this skillet with one handle(very heavy alone so with food it weighs a ton!  ), be careful always to cover the handle after the iron gets hot...ouch!I gotta say I don\\'t know how the heck I was living without cast iron.  I threw all my non-stick out after all of them warped...and the crazy thing about it is that they were top-of-the-line...triple the cost of iron.  If you want to do 2 at a time it gets a little bit more complicated to use.  Easy to clean If you want to cook a LOT at one time this is the pan for you.  Would definitely make sure you want a skillet this large.  Let\\'s start off with something that is not entirely clear from the description of this Lodge skillet on the Amazon website...  You will soon be cooking on a very fine skillet that, I can attest, does every bit as good a job as the Wagner Ware.  We already have an older cast iron skillet that we use all the time, but I decided to buy a second in order to be able to use two at once.  We can even use the silicon handle over on the other pan.  Ignore that this skillet is preseasoned, YouTube how to season and care for cast iron, and you\\'ll ultimately have a good heavy duty reasonably priced cast iron skillet that will last FOREVER.Cast Iron works better the more you use it.  My older larger better used skillets work like this one \"should\" out of the box, but doesn\\'t.  Better tasting food and easy clean-up, why did I desert cast iron for so many years for the false promises of fragile toxic teflon?The pan has the gritty texture some reviewers mentioned, but it does not affect performance.  Still, I give it a five because the heft also gives the pan its great cooking qualities.  When I do so I use this huge cast iron skillet that I got from my grandmother.  I like it because of the even heating and because it holds a pound of hamburger and \\'the box\\' additions.I\\'ve tried making casseroles in my other cookware, but unfortunately they\\'re not of high enough quality and inevitably one corner will burn while the others are fine.  I never have that problem with cast iron: it heats evenly.This large skillet is also great for cooking bacon and eggs, or for hamburgers.  It seemed perfect, but after a couple of months of use, it formed a crack this morning while I was cooking pancakes.  Nothing extreme or unusual had been done to the pan; it hadn\\'t dropped, for example, just asked to cook at a medium heat.  This is the end of my love for cast iron, at least for a while.  If you want this pan, Amazon\\'s price is excellent.  It is heavy and needs to be washed differently than our other pans, but the food prepared on it is like none other.  The one improvement we made to both our 15-1/4 and 10-1/4 inch Cast-iron Skillets was to subject them to some serious sanding with our orbital sander.  The pan finish is now like glass and is 100% stick free!  There arent hot spots like with aluminum and non stick skillets.  You are only limited by your imagination when it comes to these iron skillets.Enjoy!  Obviously, it\\'s not an all clad copper core pan, but I would have expected pancakes to at least cook up more evenly than they did.  Steaks, burgers, any type of sauteed chicken recipe, stir-fry, fajitas, cornbread, bacon and eggs, pancakes, french toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, and on and on.Cast iron\\'s chief strength comes from its massiveness.  Imagine trying to pick that up, plus the weight of whatever you\\'ve cooked in it, with one oven-mitted hand so that you can use a spoon in the other hand to help maneuver your recipe into a serving dish or storage container!  No dishwasher, no soap (just hot water and a stiff brush), dry quickly and coat with cooking oil.I\\'ve read some reviews where folks are saying that you can\\'t cook tomato-based or acidic products in cast iron.  in my cast iron and haven\\'t seen any ill effects from doing so.These pans are so inexpensive, it will cost you very little to give them a try.  I deliberately waited to review this product, because there are so many reviews which praise or dismiss cast iron within a few days or weeks of them using it for the first time.  So please take this review from someone who had the patience to experiment with the pros and the cons.Personally, I feel that cast iron, in general, is fantastic, because it will last for several life times if taken care of properly.  In addition, it doesn\\'t have Teflon, which is becoming a constant concern for those who know better.Pros:It is durable for decades, if not centuries, IF CARED FOR PROPERLY.It distributes heat more evenly.It retains heat longer than other cookware.Once well seasoned, it almost takes care of itself.If you have a recipe that requires you to start the meal on the burner, then transfer it to the oven, this is perfect, since you don\\'t have to worry about some plastic or silicone handle grip melting in the oven.  People with arthritis, or some other physical impairment may have a problem with its weight.There is a learning curve, which takes some getting use to, because of the fact that it retains heat more evenly, and retains it.Un-learning how to clean your cookware can be counterintuitive.  (It removes the seasoning that makes cast iron so great and virtually nonstick.  )The 10.25 inch skillet is deep enough, in my opinion, to be more of a pan, and not a skillet.  Realistically, while the cast iron will probably outlive you, these cleaning brushes will get gunked up rather quickly.  Yes, you\\'ll have to do some small amount of rethinking how you cook, but ultimately, anyone who is passionate about cooking will appreciate cast iron.  I\\'ve been looking for a small skillet that wasn\\'t coated with teflon for quite some time.  Here\\'s my take on this little gem:Pros:Just the right size for a single egg for breakfast or for cooking a small amount of onions or just about anything that would be too small in quantity to cover the bottom of an 8\" skillet.  Coat with olive oil after each use and you\\'re good to go.  Double hooray!Cons:You\\'ve got to be a little more thoughtful about caring for this skillet than you are with the pans that are found in most grocery and big-box stores.  But that care requires more thoughtfulness than a big investment of time.Conclusion:For small jobs, this is the pan.  These things are great for cooking 3-4 steaks at one time or a huge pan of onions/peppers/fried chicken.If you have a nice gas stove and feed 4+ people regularly, get this 15&#34; skillet.  Now after rinsing with hot water (no soap) I dry it with a dish towel, rub a dab of oil around it before putting it away.  Canola oil works better than olive oil for the treating because it can take the higher temp and is thinner.I can\\'t go 5 stars because the pan is heavy...but that\\'s the nature of cast iron...takes two hands to lift.I also have an enameled Le Creuset skillet but I like the straight sides of the Lodge better.  I\\'ve been wanting to buy this skillet for many months now, particularly when I\\'ve read how nonstick pans have a coating that eventually leaches into your food.  I have to admit, I was not attracted by the look of the pan, but did not want to shell out large amounts of money for the higher-end enamel skillets.  Seasoning is easy.  After I clean the pan with hot water and a brush, I dry it with a towel.  I then use a pastry brush and brush a little oil on the pan, put it on the burner and turn the heat to medium high.  What could go wrong with an iron skillet?  Cast iron cookware has excellent heat retention properties and can be produced and formed with a relatively low level of technology.  It is reasonably priced, easy to cook with and the food  tastes delicious.  The most popular, and it seems, the last producer of good cast iron pans is Lodge.  Based in Tennessee, the company has a superb reputation.Cast iron cookware needs to be seasoned and \\'barefoot Bob\\' who has a popular review here seems to know the ins and outs, so follow his instructions.  Thus is the perfect pan, heart resistant handle that can and should be removed in hot ovens.  American made Lodge cast iron is simply the best to cook with and is amazingly easy to maintain.  The pan had a pit (-one star), surface is not super smooth and like other reviewers have said the preseasoning is a joke.  After cleaning with hot water and a scrubby brush, I just place it on the stove on low, and rub some on the surface with a paper towel.  I don\\'t care what they say about their magic heat conduction properties, medium high on non stick is NOT the same as high on a cast iron.  I\\'ve been using Lodge cast iron skillets for many years and I\\'ve found they\\'re in fact \"pre-seasoned\" but never to my standards.  I wish they would give full disclosure and make it very clear to people that a truly well seasoned pan can\\'t be achieved in the factory because most consumers will confuse \"pre-seasoned\" with \"well seasoned\" and then will expect the same degree of non-stick from pre-seasoned pans that you can\\'t get until or unless it is well seasoned (which can take 10 to 30 uses).Properly pre-seasoning any pan is simple as long as you have a large oven.  Carbon steel has been long used to make woks and is now becoming popular in making fry pans and skillets.  Just remember carbon steel is fragile and can shatter like stoneware if dropped or mishandled, but make great natural and relatively light-weight non-stick cookware.PRE-SEASONING ANY CAST IRON:Heat your pan.  Coat the hot pan liberally inside and out with lard or vegetable oil (must be oil that can be used in high heat frying).  I do not recommend using any oil that is not designated for use with high heat as it will cause burning and give off gases that are not good for you to breathe in....\\nNow place your skillet/pan upside down in your oven at high temperature (300F to 500F, your preference, I like 350F for cast iron and 450F for carbon steel) for at least one hour.  Seasoning is not done just at the start, when the pan is new.  To preserve and create better seasoning you must clean your cast iron correctly, never using soap.  And re-season (dry, heat, and oil it) periodically.  I coat my skillets with a thin layer of oil after I clean them - every time I clean them.  I clean them with hot water and a very stiff brush, I dry with a cotton towel, heat up to make sure all the water evaporates, add a thin coating of oil.  Just cleaning it with hot water and drying with a towel is not enough, in my opinion, because residual water that soaks into the cast iron can cause rust, even though you can\\'t see it.  As long as you wipe it out the small amount of oil that clings to the pan will NOT have an adverse effect on your health (if you\\'re trying to avoid cooking with oil).  This small amount of oil is just enough to help keep food from sticking.  It does this by filling the pores of the metal.The whole idea of seasoning is to make sure oil is absorbed into the pores of the metal, not that you need the oil to cook your food.  You can use extra oil to cook your food if you want, but with a well-seasoned pan very little added oil will be needed.  It\\'s always a process of using the pan over and over that gets it to true \"non-stick\".  The more often you use and season your pan the smoother the surface will get and the more non-stick it will get.  It can take 10, 20, or more uses (with proper washings and proper seasonings) before you see a nice smooth surface that is truly non-stick.  You\\'ll know you\\'re achieved great seasoning when small drops of water or oil roll around in your pan like drops of rain on a well waxed car.PS) Some say frying a cup or more of chives in oil in your newly seasoned pan will help it become slicker faster (enhancing non-stick properties).  It will also make the metal darker, and this will tell you it\\'s getting better seasoned.  * For full disclosure:I did not buy my 8 inch Lodge skillet from Amazon but I wish I did.  I\\'ve purchased other Lodge skillets through Amazon and directly from Lodge, but I was in a hurry to get this 8 inch pan (I needed it that day for a dinner party) so I purchased from Fred Meyer and I paid over $16.  I really like knowing that I finally have a cast iron skillet.  I already have a large cast-iron pan and a tiny one, so I wanted one that is medium sized to make a few eggs for breakfast.  I started using cast-iron as an alternative to non-stick and aluminum pans when I found out the dangers of using such pans.  Now I only use stainless steel and cast-iron and this one is a great one.  a wonderful cast iron pan.  a wonderful cast iron pan.  great for pasta, large skillet dishs.wish I had a cover.  Lodge dutch oven to get him for his birthday, but as I scrolled through the Lodge cast iron cookware and passed the Lodge 12\" skillet, I noticed it was on sale for $15.90, with free shipping.  I already own a Lodge 12\" cast iron skillet, but for that low price, now I have two.  In reality, the Lodge cast iron skillet is a rarity, an excellent value at it\\'s normal retail price.  The skillet will last a lifetime, with minimal care, and actually get better the more you use it.  Think of how many meals will be made over the course of a lifetime with a Lodge cast iron skillet, for the price of a single fast food meal for two.  I decided to buy Lodge seasoned cast iron 12\" pan because it is USA made, reasonable price, and many great reviews.  I followed the instructions to season it again and clean the pan, it is so easy!  The cast iron pan does need a little more oil than the non-stick pan.  When doing stir-fry, the meat stick to the pan a little.  Just add a little water, the meat will come off the pan easily.  Cast iron pan is heavy compared to my non-stick aluminum pans, but will take iron in my food anytime than aluminum.  The handle is shorter than my regular pans, and the handle can get very hot during cooking.  I love my Lodge pans.  If you are not used to sturdy cookware, this may seem heavy, but if you want the best, you may find this to be the optimal balance between sufficient cooking mass to retain and distribute heat, and being still light enough to hold in one hand.  The 6&#34; pan is light, but a little too small for many cooking jobs.  Rub a little cooking oil on at the end of each use, too.  The only time I wish I had a stainless steel pan is for frying eggs or fish, which are both very difficult to scrape of the pan (and don\\'t need the heating properties of cast iron, anyway).  I use them all the time and love them .  I then put alittle and I mean very little like a film of shortening back on the pan.Then store it till you use again.  Another point for non stick is to get the skillet HOT first then add oil and cook your egges ect...!Cast iron the first NON STICK finish and my opinion is its the best.  We really like it and have recommended it as a good value I didn\\'t know what pre-seasoned meant.  Surprisingly, oil is somehow baked into the finish of the cooking surface of the cast iron allowing you to cook foods and not worry about the food becoming hopelessly stuck to the pan.I love that I can get this pan HOT and not worry about what\\'s going to happen to the cooking surface.  The pan imparts more of a grilled look and taste to meats than I\\'ve been able to achieve in my non-stick pans.This pan is tough and will last as long as I do.So far, the pan hasn\\'t been horribly sticky and it\\'s a breeze to clean with the polycarbonate pot scrapers.  I don\\'t use soap to clean it.  I then quickly scrape with the scrapers, rinse a few times, dry, lightly coat cooking surface with cooking oil and put it away.  She cannot wait to make her cornbread :-) As I have said in my other reviews...I LOVE cast iron cookware and I love Lodge.  The pros are numerous: it\\'s durable, easy to clean and maintain, it cooks evenly, and will last you literally FOREVER with proper care.  This little skillet is great for sauteing mushrooms, onions or vegies.  Cooking a small batch of cornbread and actually it\\'s great for just about anything!  I can\\'t say enough great things about Lodge!  I was skeptical about the pre-seasoning, but its done excellently and the pan cooks great out of the box.  I would have preferred the 10 inch pan only because this one is so heavy and probably takes longer to heat up than the smaller one.  I bought this preseasoned one but seasoned it anyways before I used it because it looked a little chipped.4 stars, only because of the size.  It\\'s fantastic that such a great way for cooking meat is so highly recommended by chefs and foodies everywhere yet is still so affordable and accessible to everyone.The Lodge Logic cast iron skillets are amazingly solid and heavy skillets that are pre-seasoned and coated so they are ready to use and grill.These things literally last for years and have the important characteristic of getting extremely hot compared to an ordinary pan that will do wonders for your steak cooking.A few notes/advice:1) Don\\'t put a lot of oil on this.  A tiny bit is fine, but the char and coating of the skillet add to the flavor of the steak.2) Don\\'t use soap to clean this.  I made the mistake of not doing so and the cast iron can quickly rust.  In most cases, the rust can be scrubbed off, but after a few times it can definitely be an issue and I bought a new one.4) These are great for placing in ovens.  This is my first cast iron skillet.  This is my first cast iron skillet.  This is my first cast iron skillet.  This is my first cast iron skillet.  This is my first cast iron skillet.  After trying it out for a couple of months, I totally love it.I find it perfect for cooking one or two eggs in the morning.  So if you don\\'t like the weight of cast iron cookware, this one is not a problem.Things like eggs got sticky at the beginning, but after several times of use, it became as easy as non-stick skillets.  It holds heat so well I can finally get a nice sear on a steak with my old weak stove burner.  It\\'s a bit heavy but hey it\\'s cast iron.  This is a good value as these last forever with proper care not like the teflon coated pans which are dangerous to use when the coating eventually starts peeling (poison).Her only recommendation is to clean and dry it as soon as it cools.It becomes harder to clean if you let pan greases sit in it over night.If you lose the shine on this just coat it with a little vegetable oil and leave it in the oven with the pilot light on for a couple of days and it will be good as new.  For the first few times I used this 9&#34; skillet, I had to scrape the bottom hard to keep food from sticking and burning.  Finally, after using this skillet 8 times and cleaning it properly, food no longer sticks to it!!  The only con about this skillet is that it has a rough surface on the inside, Lodge could have made this a lot smoother than it is, but overall doesn\\'t seem to matter too much as, again, it now works like a teflon skillet.  As a first time cast iron owner, I need directions for maintnenance.  It is heavy and cooks well, just need to know how to clean it.  Nothing lightweight about this cast-iron skillet.  I use it primarily for frying and it maintains the heat perfectly for large batches of fish or chicken.  I also own the 12 inch skillet which is great.  This is probably the best-priced cast iron pan you can find, and it\\'s working great for me so far.  Lodge\\'s website recommends washing with no soap if you know your pan got hot enough to sanitize anything on it, but they do say mild soap can be OK if you\\'re really concerned about it.  Basically, I recommend following the manufacturer\\'s instructions if you\\'ve never used these before since they might be different from what you\\'re used to.One note: the entire pan is cast iron, including the handle.  Since this is not insulated, you\\'ll want to remember to use a pot holder or slip on a silicone or other protective pan handle cover on it.  except a microwave.In summary, this is a great pan, and it\\'s quickly become my favorite skillet.  It is a bit heavy (hard to lift with one hand while trying to scrape the contents into a bowl, for example), but that\\'s the case with pretty much any good cast iron pan and something I\\'m learning to work around better.  If mine gets a little too dirty, I\\'ll scrape with the Lodge scraper, coat with canola oil, heat up a bit, then mop up with paper towels.  These skillets are great for a fried egg, and I really mean \\'A\\' fried egg but they are better for using to serve appetizers in.  I will be trying chicken this way soon.I\\'ve noticed this pan cooks on a lower heat setting.  The food was a bit too soft.This pan is not good for sauteeing chef style (where you flip the pan by hand), as it\\'s just too heavy for that.Best tools/methods:Preseason it.Pam (for storage and cooking).  This pan is heavy and requires a bit of extra care to ensure it doesn\\'t rust, but it cooks very evenly, holds its heat extremely well, is made in the U.S.A., and will become a family heirloom.  It will definitely rust if you leave any type of wet food or liquid in it for more than ten minutes, but that\\'s easy to clean off with a bit of oil and some kosher salt wiped around with paper towels.  We\\'ve seared meat on top of the stove, then transferred it to the oven to finish cooking.Everyone needs this pan in their kitchen as a kitchen basic!  It\\'s a big skillet, made of cast-iron.  If I do, I will most likely use the smaller skillet on more of a day-to-day basis.  My wife and I have a good relationship; but after receiving this skillet I am going to make sure it stays that way.  I love this pan and use it frequently.  I wish i had a good lid for it,  and i rusted it very slightly on the bottom trying to clean it over just a few hours, but that\\'s easy to fix.  I had a 10&#34; pre-seasoned skillet that worked wonderfully but now I have upgraded to a 12&#34;!  My old teflon pan was ideal for frying eggs; they slide right off.  Straightforward cast iron skillet.  The pretreatment is better than nothing, but it does still requires some seasoning, or at least some regular use for awhile before it reaches full seasoning, so don\\'t be surprised if things stick a little in the beginning despite the pretreatment.  Cast iron gets better with time with a lot of use, as long as one doesn\\'t use soap.  If food is allowed to cool in it and it is stuck on, it is still easy to clean with hot water, a stiff brush, and a little elbow grease.  This pan is the perfect size for my household.  This skillet is turning out to be a very handy addition to my large (and growing) collection of Lodge Logic cast iron.It\\'s a great size to fry a couple of eggs (and since a lid from another set of cookware fits, I can poach the eggs in this skillet too), reheat a single portion of leftovers, or bake up that cup or two of leftover batter (so who wants to pop the muffin pan back into the oven for such a small amount?  ).All in all, a great little pan!  In fact I love it to and I find myself using this more then she does, we rarely even use our other pans.  Lighter than the 12&quot; pan - still works great.

Polished cast iron does offer the benefit of more exposed internal pores, so the seasoning sticks better, but I\\'ve never had an issue seasoning so this point is moot.I\\'ve done both high heat and medium heat for seasoning, and I find that the hotter the oven the better the seasoning.  If you fail to season above 350f, you will likely end up with a browned pan that is slightly sticky because the fat didn\\'t form a polymer, and will make you leave an unnecessary low star Amazon review and never know the benefits of cast iron.  My suggestion is scrub the skillet with steel wool and soap until the water runs clear and you\\'re sure there\\'s no soap remaining on the cast iron.  Dry the skillet completely, and cover with oil; make sure you get the handles, bottom, and top.  This initial seasoning layer isn\\'t quite ready for primetime, if you were to cook something with tomatoes, lemons, vinegar you could very well screw it all up because of the low PH reacting to the thin layer of fat polymer and possibly penetrating all the way to the cast iron.  Too much science for me, so to be on the safe side if I\\'m going to be using the oven with temperatures in excess of 375f I make sure the cast iron gets another layer of fat and gets re-seasoned.  First and foremost, I use metal utensils on it because it inevitably makes it easier to clean if stuff isn\\'t stuck to it for very long.  I\\'ve read that because we generally don\\'t use dish soaps that contain lye, they should be gentle enough to use on cast iron.

I use a stiff brush & some warm water, usually works great, especially if you do it right after taking the food out of the pan.  If there is food stuck on the bottom of the pan that does not easily come out using the stiff brush & warm water, then just put some water in the pan, sit it back on the stove until the water starts to simmer, then scrub the pan right away- that has worked for me every time.

Simply run under hot water and if necessary wipe out with a steel wool.I have a few different sized pans, as well as a variety of seasoned and unseasoned.By far this 10\" is the best.  ), and then throw my steak in--it would smoke like mad and the meat would turn BLACK (love blackened steaks!)  But this did wonderful things for the seasoning--the interior became glossy smooth and good Lord, nowadys I used this skillet for everything from scrambled eggs to veggies--nothing STICKS in the least and the flavor is incredible!  Everyday hard use and abuse is what REAL seasoning is about!___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I had to buy this online, because good luck trying to find this size in any retail store...!  The tiny 8\" (with a 6\" cooking surface) is everywhere, as is the 10.5\" (which I have and love), but this size is perfect for a single steak or small meals for one person.  I like blackened steaks, getting the pan beyond searing hot, and so this is a great little dedicated steak pan that I can get so hot it almost carbonizes the seasoning off, and I don\\'t have to worry about using it for anything else.  However that hasn\\'t happened yet, despite getting the pan up to 850F  over a high BTU gas burner, and having some incredible steaks (with lots of black smoke!)  Kudos to Lodge for a very well done pre-seasoning process.This pan did come with some noticable and unsightly cast iron crap (over-spill) from the casting process, attached to the top lip in one area.  However the pan is so easy to use since it is Pre-seasoned, and been so useful for my steak cooking (and I have even scrambled eggs with no sticking), that I forgive Lodge the cosmetic blemishes even though I paid full retail + shipping.The logic Pre-seasoned line is really that good.  You will still need to season it slowly, over time, for it to be like our grandmothers age-old seasoning was like on their Griswolds and Wagners, but it\\'s a great start.For frying and searing, cast iron just cannot be beat.  Plus the Lodge products (flawed as they may be) are really superior to many of the cheaper cast iron pans coming in from China (that are pre-seasoned or coated with God-knows-what!  We use it once every couple of weeks but when we need it it works fine.  This is replacing our large non-stick skillet and is working out well other than needing a lid, nothing we have will fit.  I bought this to do high heat cooking that I did not want to do in my All Clad pans.  A great pan for the money.  It has worked perfectly so far, I will take care of it, and I expect to get many years of good use out of this pan.  This is the cast iron pan I go to for most of my skillet needs, good size and great performance.  Season it regularly, clean it with water (no soap) and a cast iron scrubber, and keep it oiled.  Love this frying pan from Lodge.  I highly recommend Cooks great, no sticking, seasoned well!  I bought the 12\" Cast Iron skillet on Amazon and was honestly a little concerned with what kind of quality I would be getting because the price was so low.I love this skillet!  It\\'s really a perfect cast iron skillet.  It\\'s really a perfect cast iron skillet.  I am constantly destroying my skillets and thought cast iron might be smart for me.  If this thing can stand up to me, it can stand up to anything!I now realize I do need to improve my upper body strength :)  The Lodge 12\" Skillet is very, very heavy.  If it didn\\'t have the extra handle, I would not be able to lift this pan at all.Awesome quality, great price, smart design - of all the items in my kitchen, this pan is my favorite.  These skillets need additional seasoning for their full cooking potential.  After frying in it just once, the skillet will turn completely black and gets better with each subsequent use.Excellent quality cast iron.  This size also makes a  wonderful deep dish pizza pan.  But I make sure to always season after each use, as suggested by some of the reviews.  Cleaning was a bit different from non-stick.  Seemed easy to clean, but needed oiling.  and it came out perfect.  When I got this item, the cooking surface was smooth and ready.  I fully intend to get a couple of other cast iron items from this seller / manufacturer.  I had recently spent $50 and was so dissapointed with another brand .Update------------------------------I\\'m still loving my cast Iron pan its been over a year now and I just wanted togive 2 tidbits of advice.  I have found butter to be better than oil for keeping the pan seasoned.  I do wash my pan with a sponge with very diluted soap then I set it over the stove and light the fire for 2 min this drys out the pan to prevent rust and then I add a little butter just when I turn off the flame.I use a paper towl and carefully wipe the butter around the hot pan.  And cast iron is easy to clean and maintain.  They go crazy for them.Absolutely nothing cooks like cast iron.  I have returned it and will try ordering one again to see if I can get a good one.I\\'m leary of skillets shipped by Amazon though.  Great for frying chicken, bacon, hash browns, eggs - you name it.  Lots of great cast iron skillet recipes on the Lodge website too.  This cast iron fry pan arrived in excellent shape and it was well packaged.  Cast iron never goes bad.  I also have a 15\" Lodge skillet, and I love that for large roasts or just feeding a large crew.  This is perfecct- reasonably priced- small but large enough for a \"1 person meal\" and PRE-SEASONED...It\\'s great!  I am ready to ditch my all-clad non-stick pans, and this is the perfect replacement.  Since this pan comes pre seasoned, it took very little effort but to wash it according to the directions and begin using it right away.  Since the pan is so heavy, I just leave it on my stove, and in doing so, it\\'s what I use for whatever I cook.  I\\'ve only had one instance where my food stuck, and that was because I failed to heat up the pan enough and add enough oil.  Much to his delight I works just fine, heats up evenly and came well seasoned so we could use it right out of the box.  This is great for kids who love to cook.  but it takes awhile for the food to stop sticking, other wise I recommend, nice and sturdy, not too heavy, just the right size for single meals.  And the preseasoning is good, doesn\\'t need to be scrubbed off like others (although yes, I do heat my pans up before cooking - read the instructions that come with it) just heavy cooks great clean up is easy and the  lid fits perfecttly i ould recommend it for everyone :) This \"seasoned\" pan is sensational.  I size my pans to my cooktop burner size and the heat distribution is perfect.  Tried the other day, guess I lost my original pan, they just didn\\'t cook good, so I went to Amazon...wham they were there.  my perfect little fried egg pan (or small amount of veggies, sausage, w/e)can\\'t wait to make some cornbread in it!  The result is that I can cook stuff in it and very little of it sticks...and if it does, it\\'s not so bad I can\\'t get it off with a bare minimum of work.And everything just tastes better after being cooked in a cast iron skillet...fried eggs, chicken, grilled cheese, etc.After use, I bring it over to the sink and run it, still hot, under very hot water and scrub with a long handled scrub brush made for this purpose.  Once dry, I pour in a bit of vegetable oil, swish it around with a paper towel, and wipe up the excess and hang it on my pot rack till next time.Another way of cleaning is to let it cool, put water in, heat on the stove and then transfer it all to the sink where, again, using very hot water and no soap, I scrub the bits out.  I then allow it to dry on the burner (turned off) and reseason with oil when it\\'s dry.I know it sounds like a lot of work, but really, it\\'s much quicker and easier than some of my other pots and pans...even the so-called \"non-stick\" ones.I love the weight of it and the feeling of durability...properly cared for, these things should probably last a hundred years or more.  Years ago I \\'upgraded\\' (young me, then) and got rid of my cast iron cooking pans, and for years I\\'ve been sorry, but didn\\'t want to spend more money re-purchasing.  Something finally made me decide to buy this one - partially because these days all the pans are pre-seasoned, and partially because this one was made in USA.  I\\'ve used it a few times so far, and find it is really better than my old pan, and I\\'m a happy (older and wiser?)  I just started getting into cast iron cooking and it is much better than anything else I have used.  I only have one old cast iron skillet and it is much smoother than these but I assume over time these will get much much better.  Seriously though, this is a great skillet.  Hamburger tastes better than a normal pan and most anything tastes better and cooks better on the skillet.  This might help with some extra iron in your diet if you\\'re anemic.Cleaning: Clean immediately after use with soap and a sponge.  Then oil the whole thing with any type of cooking oil with a light coat.  We use a lot of cast iron in our house and I bought this one because my 12 inch was just a little over kill for most jobs.  This pan is great for a few pieces of bacon and eggs in the morning and many other jobs where I really don\\'t need a large pan.  Need to cook bacon or other fatty foods in it to help with the surface to achieve a good non stick status.  I render my own lard and use it on many saut&eacute;ing projects which helps to get my pans up to the level I like them I think everyone already knows that these are 5 star products.  If you don\\'t love cast iron, then you don\\'t know how to cook.  If anyone ever tells you they love their skillet, it\\'s probably cast iron.  Seems like this is one of the only cast iron brands that you can buy, they\\'ve done it right!  This pan was larger than I had expected, it\\'s a great size.  I can see it being perfect for doing fish, pork chop sandwiches, or any other kind of masculine food that I eat.A+++++++ I use this tiny little skillet almost daily during the winter to quickly melt small amounts of coconut oil.  (Coconut oil turns solid anytime the temperature falls below the high 60s.)  I picked it up at whole foods and thought it would be perfect for melting butter in after making stove-top pop corn and it is.  I liked the small shall size because my other melting pan was too deep at 2 cups.  Seasoning a cast iron pan yourself is really easy.  This skillet is by far the busiest pan in my kitchen.  I use it daily.I love to cook, and this skillet is so versatile.  I am cooking for two, but this skillet will easily accommodate more.  Plus, if you love to cook, but don\\'t have a large family, I urge you to get this large skillet.  Handy smaller cast iron pan for the oven...Great to make that smaller meal all in one pan when I bake in the oven...Used by restaurants for single servings a lot too....The best for mac & cheese...gooey buns...and any single serving...The cast iron pan takes a few minutes to heat up before you start to avoid sticking messes when used on the stove top...and clean up easy just wash it out while it is hot the food usually slides off...then re-season the pan with oil while it is still warm and it is ready for the next use....Makes great corn bread too....Eggs this is just the right pan...No real draw backs it is a small cast iron pan what more can be said..  I use this skillet for cooking bacon and most of my meat.  This skillet is so good it makes me cook more often.  I have never been more happy with a $10 purchase in my lifetime.You will need to season the skillet, or any new cast iron skillet, yourself.  I primarily bought cast iron cookware to escape Teflon, but I found that it\\'s been a fun addition to our kitchen.  Though it requires grease, I find seasoned cast-iron just as non-stick as Teflon.  I sometime get little bits that stick in the pan, but the cleanup is easy enough.  So potatoes, rice, pasta, etc, need to be cooked in a different pan.  I had mine for over a year and it cooks everything great.  Some people complain that it is not as smooth as an old Griswold or Wagner which is true since I also own a few of these skillets but with added seasoning they even out nicely.  Lodge products are a great value on Amazon and over the past year I bought the 5 qt Dutch oven (which I love), round griddle (makes the best pancakes), square grill pan and fajita set.  Cleans beautifully, preseasoned, just the right size, and it comes with the hot handle!  Great size for baking or frying.  I don\\'t know what I would do with out this Pan The LODGE-LOGIC 12 inch Pre-Seasoned, is the one I use the most, it came Pre-Seasoned so I didn\\'t have to do anything to it, is the Pan I reach for when I\\'m about to fry or cook anything and nothing sticks to it, and it suppose to be healthier for you.  I wash it by hand, Towel dry and do not use any Soap or Detergent and sometimes while is warm I wipe a light coat of vegetable oil all over it; I want to keep building the non-stick surface.  F., I only wash it in hot water when cleaning it and put in on the stove after drying it out, turn the burner on for 3 Min., apply peanut oil all around the indide of the pan and it\\'s ready to use again with no rust forming.  I don\\'t cook mini/novelty foods, but it would be great for that.  It takes up no space, it is indestructible if you keep it dry, and it is just right for a few things.Cast iron is great stuff.  When properly cared for, it is the original non-stick, with no weird industrial chemicals.These pans will outlive you, and they are made in the USA.  I kept hearing the statement that cast iron was \"the original non-stick pan\".I used this pan to cook some eggs after I bought it with horrible results.Then, I started cooking meats (steak pork chops, etc) in it.  The more I used it after that, the more everything slid off of it like it was made of glass.This pan has a permanent spot on top of my stove now.  What\\'s more, it\\'s the most reliable pan I have that goes from stove-top to oven, and back.The other great thing about it is that you can bring it along with your dutch oven on your camping trips to cook over an open fire/coals.As far as the heft (weight) of this thing goes, if anyone doesn\\'t understand what cast iron is all about, they shouldn\\'t be buying it.  First I lightly oiled with veggie oil and baked 1 hour to make sure it was ready to use.To make cornbread:------------------------------Heat pan on stove (medium high heat), add2 TBSP of real butter to melt the butter.  Pour in the cornbread batter, remove from stove and bake as directed.For some reason the cast iron makes a great crust on the cornbread.This pan is just the right size for cornbread.  Its heavy, but if you can handle the weight, its prefect size for steaks.10-12inch is ok for one or 2 small pieces, 15inch is prefect and also retain heat better per the big mass.  Cast iron is perfect for making a great steak in your home.  It evenly heats the steak and allows you to sear in the flavor.Some note about the skillet:Its large and heavy, many people will need two hands to move it.  I also bought a cook book for it and it came with tips on keeping this guy seasoned and how to cook better with it since Im kind of a goon at why these are better than other pans.  Meat and vegetables browned on the cast iron skillet taste way better that from the non stick pan.  This skillet was well seasoned out of the box, so we only have to keep covering it inside with a thin film of oil after each use.The 13.25 inch size is perfect, we can reuse the lid we had for our non stick 13 inch pan.The silicone handles help a lot, because the thing is heavy.  What a pleasure to cook with this little skillet.  Before purchasing this, my only cast iron was the 12 inch skillet, but, because of its size, I hardly ever used it.  It weighs 100 pounds and the cooking surface looks like an asphalt parking lot.But THIS little beauty is the perfect size and weight for cooking for one.  According to another reviewer, Joe Bob (Lodge Logic L8SK3 10-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet), if your skillet feels a little sticky or tacky and food sticks, it\\'s because it wasn\\'t seasoned at a high enough temp so the first thing I did was wash this with a drop of dish washing liquid and add to the pre-seasoning.  Of course, as y\\'all know (and now I know), the real selling point for cast iron cooking is that food tastes 100% better.  :-) This pan is the perfect size for people who like to back pack or camp.  Just use warm water and a light scrubing pad to make sure the pan stays seasoned.  Its a little heavy to carry, but worth it if you like cooking anything in it.  After loving the performance of myLodge Logic Dutch Oven with loop handles, I knew the next thing I wanted to pick up was a good-sized cast iron skillet.  I own a few cast iron pans inherited from my grandma, but they were all on the smaller size and I wanted something that could handle a couple of steaks side-by-side.This 12-inch Skillet is a bit of a monster, heavy to wield and almost unmanageable once it is down on the stove, but it delivers some great flavor.  Even though I love my Calphalon non-stick pans as well, for putting a crust on a seared steak cast iron can\\'t be beat.  Plus, it can go straight off the stove top into the oven for a nice quick finish of the middle.  \"Lodge Logic\" puts out really nice cast iron cookware, at a reasonable price.  you can easily cook 5 pounds of ground beef at a time in it (with room to stir!  ), and because it\\'s cast iron, even tho it\\'s much bigger than my burner, it cooks pretty evenly.  highly recommend This is a great item to use at home or to take along with you on your camping trips.  I have a 15&#34; lodge skillet and this one is a great deal smaller, obviously lol, but its PERFECT for customizing pasta sauces, making a few eggs at a time, if using more than 3 id say get a larger size.
