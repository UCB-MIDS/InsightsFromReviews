                           If you are that guy (or girl) in the office that can not find the right chair this won't be the chair for you. <br><br> &#8208;&nbspI thought assembly would be tricky, but it only took about 15 minutes.<br />The chair is very solid and reasonably comfortable.

                           If you want a good chair, I'd recommend going to....I dunno, I think Staples has displays of chairs that you can actually test out before buying them.

                           &#8208;&nbspNo extrenuous force was applied, this was normal wear and tear.Got this last December as a birthday present, it was a great chair for a while, quite comfortable really.

                           &#8208;&nbspI do not feel like I am sinking into a chair and I appreciate that in a desk chair.<br />(2) This chair DOES recline and feels stable.<br />(3) Solid wheelbase for someone my height and weight<br />(4) Lumbar support pillow is actually where I need it to be which has helped with improving my posture, relieve muscular fatigue and pain.<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1) The Lift & Lower Mechanism breaks easily, even when almost never used.
